FOREWORD The British Survey of Fertiliser Practice (BSFP) provides information on fertiliser and manure use on the major crops and grass grown in mainland Britain.
The 2024 Survey was funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Scottish Government. The Survey has the full support of the Farmers' Unions in England, Scotland, and Wales.
The Survey is carried out annually and is based upon returns from a sample of farms. In 2024, the Survey was co-ordinated by Kynetec, who were responsible for the survey design, data collection, statistical analysis, and quality control monitoring.
Data uses The information in this publication is widely used by the UK government, international organisations, industry, and researchers. It contains data on trends in usage and application rates of nitrogen, phosphate, potash, sulphur, organic manures, and lime on agricultural crops and grassland in Great Britain.
The Survey data provide important evidence to assess greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. These aid in informing the ammonia and greenhouse gas inventories and the development of possible mitigation measures. They are also used for developing and assessing the impact of policy on water quality and the environment. The data have additionally been used for indicators on nutrient balances, other indicators relating to environmental impacts and other cross cutting work, looking at links between fertiliser use, productivity (benchmarking) and economic performance. Industry and government use the data to monitor best practice.
Information on all of these topics is available from the GOV.UK website, with publications on greenhouse gas emissions, agriculture and climate change, NVZs and soil nutrient balances of particular relevance.
Other information Defra also run other surveys which may be of relevance to fertiliser use and related practices through its Farm Practices Survey for England, which is available on the Defra website.
The following shorthand has been used in many of the data tables in this report, in accordance with best practice from the Office of National Statistics:
 The shorthand [c] is used where a data point, if displayed, might disclose confidential information. Data based on responses from fewer than five fields have been suppressed.
 The shorthand [x] is used where data are not available. In most cases this is where some data displayed in a table were not collected in every year of the survey.
 The shorthand [z] is used where data are not applicable.
 The shorthand [p] is used where data are provisional.
Data revisions See Appendix 3 AA3.2.6 for details of revisions made in this edition.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The British Survey of Fertiliser Practice (BSFP) is an annual, nationally representative interview survey based on the selection of a random stratified sample of farms from mainland Britain. The main purpose of the Survey is to estimate average application rates of nitrogen, phosphate and potash used for agricultural crops and grassland. The data provide important evidence to assess greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and for developing possible mitigation measures. Information is also collected on applications of sulphur fertilisers, organic manures, and lime. The main findings from the 2024 Survey on the use of the nutrients nitrogen, phosphate, potash, and sulphur in Great Britain are summarised below (Table ES1).

The survey year (which is the same as the crop year) ran from autumn 2023 to autumn 2024, corresponding to the 2024 crop year and the 2024 harvest.
Cropping patterns can influence fertiliser rates and dressing covers observed. In 2024 there was a 5% reduction in the area of crops planted. In addition, 28% of cropping farms and 38% of cropping area was reported to be growing cover crops. The area sown to cereals was largely consistent, albeit with an 11% reduction in the wheat area and a 19% increase in the spring barley area. Oilseed rape sown area continued to decline. When comparing to 2019 there was a 9% reduction in the area sown to crops and a 4% reduction in the area of grass.
The weather, which can impact cropping patterns, is described in Appendix 3.
Key findings: Executive Summary Average field rates for nitrogen decreased on both the cropping and grass categories in 2024, having recovered somewhat in 2023 from the low levels observed in 2022. The 2022 levels were thought to be attributable largely to price and the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.
Average field rates and dressing cover percentages for phosphate, potash and sulphur were subject to small changes on both crops and grass. Winter-sown crops and grass both noted a reduced number of total applications of fertilisers and also of specific applications of nitrogen in 2024.
Figure ES1 Overall application rate (kg/ha) of major nutrients on all crops and grass, Great Britain 1983 – 2024 Nitrogen: Executive Summary  Nitrogen usually has a large immediate effect on crop growth, yield and quality. Most agricultural soils in Great Britain contain too little naturally occurring plant-available nitrogen to meet the needs of a crop, so supplementary nitrogen applications must be made each year.
2


---
 The 4 kg/ha decrease in total nitrogen use on all crops and grassland in 2024 resulted from a 4 kg/ha decrease in the overall application rate on crops to 121 kg/ha and a 4 kg/ha decrease on grass to 34 kg/ha.
 Mineral fertiliser nitrogen levels applied to grassland have been consistently lower than on crops. Overall application rates of nitrogen on crops remained relatively constant for several decades before lower levels observed in the last few years. Overall application rates on grass declined significantly from 2000-09 then remained steady until much lower levels were observed in the last couple of years. The decline in cattle numbers, due to a lessening of stocking density, is thought to have contributed to this reduction in the nitrogen rate on grassland, possibly in conjunction with some improvement in manure use efficiency. In addition, the impacts of higher fertiliser price following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine are still being witnessed in reduced application rates. The 2024 overall nitrogen rate on grassland is the same as 2022 at 34 kg/ha, the lowest ever recorded by this survey. Please refer to table AA1.1  In 2024 the overall application rates of total nitrogen decreased on all the major crops except spring barley and sugar beet. Average field rates changed in the 1-3 kg/ha range for the major arable crops except for spring barley which was unchanged from 2023. Please refer to tables A1.3a and A1.3b.
Phosphate and potash: Executive Summary  Phosphate and potash are applied in fertilisers and manures, particularly to replace the quantities removed in harvested crops. Most British soils can hold large quantities of these nutrients for crop uptake over several years. Consequently, the timing of maintenance application tends to be less time critical compared to nitrogen or sulphur.
 Overall application rates of phosphate and potash applied to crops are normally about three times those used on grassland. However, there is greater use of applied manures on grassland (48% dressing cover for grass <5 years old, 33% for grass of 5 years or more) than on crops (27% cover) and grazed grassland also receives manure as it is grazed. Please refer to Appendix 2, table GB1.1.
 Overall phosphate application rates on crops declined gradually between 1984 and 1996. Thereafter the decline in rates became more marked until 2009, after which there was some recovery and relative stability until 2018, when a 3 kg/ha decrease to 27 kg/ha was recorded. Overall phosphate rates on crops have declined every year since to a figure of 17 kg/ha in 2024. The overall application rate of phosphate on grassland was highest in 1983, at 28 kg/ha, and remained relatively stable between 1984 and 1998. Overall application rates declined more rapidly between 1999 and 2009, but then remained relatively stable, with a further, sizeable drop in 2022 to 4 kg/ha. This rate was unchanged in 2024. Please refer to table AA1.3.
 Overall potash application rates on crops declined slightly between 1983 and 1997, with the rates in the 60-68 kg/ha range. Like phosphate, overall application rates reduced at a greater rate after this time, dropping to 33 kg/ha in 2009 when fertiliser prices were high. Between 2014 and 2018 overall potash application rates were reasonably stable in the range 35-40 kg/ha, but have since declined again, with a further fall in 2024 of 1 kg/ha to 22 kg/ha. Please refer to table AA1.4.
 Whilst the pattern of use of potash on grassland has been more variable, this also showed a net decline between 1983 and 2008, following relative stability in the mid-late 1980s. Since 2009, overall potash rates fluctuated between 11 and 14 kg/ha, before 3

dropping to 6 kg/ha in 2022. In 2023 and 2024 the overall potash rate on grass was unchanged at 6 kg/ha. Please refer to table AA1.4.
 It is of note that in Scotland, the phosphate and potash application rates on cropped land have largely been maintained, relative to the decline seen in England & Wales.
Although there has been a reduction in dressing covers and overall application rates since 2004, they were relatively stable again on cropping by 2010. In 2024, the overall phosphate rate on crops increased in Scotland to 43 kg/ha and potash increased 5 kg/ha to 56 kg/ha. Please refer to tables AA1.3 and AA1.4.
Sulphur: Executive Summary  Sulphur is an essential plant nutrient and is a component of most proteins as well as activating certain enzyme systems. In the past, sulphur demand was satisfied through atmospheric deposition, but this contribution is now hardly significant. Therefore, there is a need for sulphur application to crops and grass; with crops such as oilseed rape being particularly sensitive to sulphur deficiency. Elemental sulphur can also be used as a soil acidifier for potatoes which can offer some protection against common scab (Streptomyces scabiei) although sulphur as a nutrient is usually applied in the sulphate form.
 The Survey has collected detailed information on sulphur (SO ) fertiliser use since 3 1993, when only 3-6% of the cereal crop areas and 8% of the oilseed rape area received a sulphur application. By 1997, these proportions had increased markedly to 13-14% for cereals and 30% for oilseed rape. Dressing covers for sulphur generally remained static until 2002, and then increased steadily to 2007. Dressing covers reduced in 2008 and 2009 for all cereals except winter barley, before continuing to increase. Since 2016, sulphur dressing covers have been relatively stable, around the 50-70% range for cereals, and 70-80% for oilseed rape. In 2024, sulphur dressing covers in cereals were in the 56-67% range, similar to 2023. Please refer to table A1.8.
 The 79% dressing cover for winter oilseed rape was 7 percentage points higher than observed in 2023 and is back in line with the five-year average of 79%. Please refer to table A1.8.
 In 2024, 32% of all crops and grass received a dressing of sulphur; this figure was 57% for crops. On crops the overall application rate for sulphur was 29 kg/ha, the same as the five-year average between 2020-2024. Applications on grass decreased in 2024 by 1 kg/ha and dressing cover increased by 1 percentage point to 13% of grass receiving a sulphur dressing in 2024. Please refer to tables AA1.5 and AA1.6.
Organic manures: Executive Summary  Historically, the Survey has focused on the application of manufactured fertilisers although in recent years (since 2007) it has also collected information on the use of organic manures. The nutrient levels in organic manures vary according to the type of manure but provide a valuable recycled source of nitrogen, phosphate, potash and sulphur. Where organic manures are used, applications of manufactured fertiliser can usually be reduced.
 In 2024, around 63% of farms used organic manures on at least one field on the farm.
Cattle manure from beef and dairy farms is by far the largest volume of manure type generated in Great Britain. In 2024, 58% of cattle manure and 90% of cattle slurry applications were made to grassland, reflecting the practice of utilising the manure on the farm on which it was produced. Please refer to table B1.1a and B2.3a.

 Fields of winter-sown crops mainly receive a manure dressing in August and September, prior to drilling, whereas spring-sown and grass fields are dressed predominantly in spring and summer.

SECTION A COMMENTARY ON FERTILISER USE IN GREAT BRITAIN This commentary refers to rates of application in mainland Britain of fertilisers containing nitrogen (N), phosphate (P O ), potash (K O) and sulphur (SO ) on crops and grassland 2 5 2 3 (excluding rough grazing). Section A1 of the report covers the five-year period 2020-24.
Comments on longer term trends are made in Section A2.
The estimates of overall application rates from the Survey relate to usage on farms during the 2024 growing season; they form a basis for estimating quantities of fertiliser used in Great Britain. The overall application rate considers both the average field rate and the proportion of the crop area treated, giving an overview of the crop as a whole. The estimates of average field rates provide a better indication than overall application rates of actual usage levels and also of any annual variation in fertiliser practice on farms. The definitions of the terms used are set out below.
Definitions:
Average field rate = fertiliser nutrient application rate over the sown area that received some dressing of that nutrient (kg/ha) Dressing cover = proportion of the sown area that has received any application of the nutrient or a manure (%) Overall application rate = fertiliser nutrient application rate over the sown area of all fields, irrespective of whether they received dressing of that nutrient or not (kg/ha).
Crop year = the crop year covers the period from the autumn of the preceding year to the autumn of the crop year i.e. the 2024 crop year ran from autumn 2023 to autumn 2024.
For full details on definitions used throughout this report, along with details on the History of the report, Survey methodology and Background information, please refer to Appendix 3.
The statistics on the pattern of fertiliser practice reported for Great Britain largely reflect practices in England & Wales due to its greater area of total crops and grassland: about 8.7 million hectares in England & Wales and about 1.9 million hectares in Scotland. In what is otherwise a commentary on Britain as a whole, remarks on the separate regions are only made to highlight particular trends of interest. Readers interested in more detailed recent trends for individual crops in England & Wales or in Scotland can refer to tables presented in Appendix 2.

A1.1.1 Nitrogen Overview of nitrogen use on all crops and grassland Table A1.1 Overall application rate of nitrogen (kg/ha), Great Britain 2020 – 2024 Total nitrogen Straight nitrogen Compound nitrogen Overall, the 4 kg/ha decrease in the application rate of nitrogen for all crops and grass in 2024 (Figure A1.1) was caused by a 4 kg/ha decrease on crops and a 4 kg/ha decrease on grass.
When compared with 2023, the rate of straight N decreased by 3 kg/ha for crops and by 2 kg/ha for grass (Figure A1.2). The rate of compound N decreased by 1 kg/ha on crops and decreased by 2 kg/ha on grass. The mean application rates of use of total N, straight N and compound N on all crops and grass over the five-year period (2020-2024) were 78 kg/ha, 64 kg/ha and 14 kg/ha, respectively.

Overview of Nitrogen use on crops: Section A1.1.1 Straight N continues to be the main source of nitrogen on crops, with 82% of cropping area receiving a straight nitrogen dressing in 2024. This was the same percentage as in 2023. The average field rate of straight N on crops decreased by 5 kg/ha to 137 kg/ha. This resulted in a 3 kg/ha decrease in the overall application rate of straight N on crops which was 113 kg/ha in 2024.
There are a several reasons for the dominance of straight nitrogen over the use of nitrogen in compound fertilisers, with the principal one being the large area of winter-sown crops. As is shown in Appendix Table AA3.3.1, about 52% of the cropping area was sown to winter cereals and winter oilseed rape in 2024. These crops can receive most of any necessary dressings of phosphate and potash in the seedbed or during the autumn and winter, leaving just the nitrogen (and sulphur) to be applied, usually as more than one dressing, during the busy spring period of active crop growth. The need for precise timing of nitrogen applications has also contributed to a separation of nitrogen applications from those of phosphate and potash for spring-sown crops, especially spring cereals and sugar beet. Thus, a continuing increase in the use of straight nitrogen now applies to most spring-sown crops for agronomic and environmental reasons, as well as for the optimisation of logistics and the efficient use of time in the spring. The exception is maincrop potatoes where compound nitrogen accounted for 74% of dressing cover in 2024.
In the context of this report and elsewhere, straight nitrogen includes nitrogen plus sulphur fertiliser products. The term "straight nitrogen" denotes a nitrogen-containing product without any associated phosphate or potash.
Overview of Nitrogen use on Grassland: Section A1.1.1 In 2024, the overall application rate for nitrogen on grass decreased by 4 kg to 34 kg/ha (Table A1.1). The proportion of grass receiving a dressing of straight N decreased by 1 percentage point to 23% in 2024 and the average field rate decreased by 8 kg/ha to 93 kg/ha in 2024. The grass area dressed with compound N decreased by 1 percentage point to 22% and the average field rate decreased by 5 kg/ha to 57 kg/ha. Overall, this resulted in a 2 kg/ha decrease to 12 kg/ha in the overall application rate of compound N on grass in 2024.
A1.1.2 Phosphate, Potash and Sulphur use Overview of Phosphate use: Section A1.1.2 Table A1.2a shows overall phosphate applications for the past five years. Compared with 2023, the overall application rate on crops was unchanged at 17 kg/ha. This resulted from an unchanged dressing cover at 35% and an increased average field rate of 49 kg/ha of phosphate on crops in 2024. For grassland too, the overall application rate was unchanged at 4 kg/ha and the dressing cover was 21%. The average field rate decreased 1 kg/ha to 19 kg/ha. The five year means for overall phosphate application rates for crops and grass were 19 kg/ha and 5 kg/ha, respectively.

Table A1.2a Overall application rate of phosphate and potash (kg/ha), Great Britain 2020 – 2024 Total phosphate Total potash Overview of Potash use: Section A1.1.2 On crops, the decrease in the overall potash application rate was caused by a 1 percentage point decrease in dressing cover to 38% with a 2 kg/ha increase in the average field rate to 60 kg/ha in 2024. On grassland, dressing cover decreased by 2 percentage points to 22% and overall application rate was unchanged at 6 kg/ha in 2024. The average field rate increased by 2 kg/ha to 28 kg/ha. The five year means for overall potash application rates for crops and grass were 25 kg/ha and 8 kg/ha, respectively.
Overview of Sulphur use: Section A1.1.2 Table A1.2b shows overall sulphur (SO ) application rates for the past five years. In 2024, the 3 overall application rate of sulphur on crops increased by 1 kg/ha to 29 kg/ha. The proportion of the cropping area receiving a sulphur dressing increased by 2 percentage points to 57% and the average field rate was unchanged at 51 kg/ha. The overall application rate of sulphur on grass decreased by 1 kg/ha to 4 kg/ha in 2024. The low overall application rate of sulphur on grass is caused by a combination of lower dressing cover percentages and lower average field rates on grass than on crops.
Table A1.2b Overall application rate of sulphur (kg/ha SO ), 3 Great Britain 2020 – 2024 A1.2 FERTILISER USE ON MAJOR CROPS IN 2024 Overall application rates and average field rates of fertiliser application for major crops in Great Britain over the past five years are summarised in Tables A1.3a and A1.3b. Dressing cover percentages for the same period are shown in Table A1.3c. More detailed statistics for 2024 are presented in Appendix 2. Longer term trends in overall application rates of nitrogen, phosphate, potash and sulphur are summarised in Section A2.
Small apparent changes in fertiliser use on individual crops should be treated with caution as these estimates are based on a smaller number of farms and fields than the aggregate estimates for all crops.

Overview of number of fertiliser applications In 2024, the majority of the main crop groups recorded a decrease in the total number of fertiliser applications, following a slight upturn in the previous season. The one exception to this trend was sugar beet, which noted an increase of 0.24 in the total number of applications.
Winter cereals and winter oilseed rape remained those crop groups with the highest total number of applications, while established grassland recorded the fewest.
The number of straight nitrogen applications decreased for winter cereals in 2024, after remaining largely constant for the preceding three seasons. While all other main groups recorded a reduction in the number of applications of straight nitrogen, to the lowest number for at least the past four years, both sugar beet and spring cereals saw increases in 2024.
Table A1.4 Average number of applications of mineral fertiliser, where applied, and those which are of straight nitrogen, to different crops or crop groups, Great Britian 2021 – 2024 A1.2.1 Nitrogen use on Major Crops In 2024, overall application rates of total nitrogen (Table A1.3a) decreased on all the major crops except spring barley and sugar beet which was unchanged from 2023. The overall application rate decreased to the greatest extent on potatoes to 128 kg/ha but these data are always more variable. Average field rates (Table A1.3b) changed in the 1-3 kg/ha range for all major crops except spring barley and potatoes. For all the major arable crops except spring barley and sugar beet dressing covers decreased slightly in 2024. For maincrop potatoes and sugar beet dressing covers were lower, but these tend to be more variable (Table A1.3c) due to the fewer fields of these crops in the survey.
Nitrogen use on Winter wheat: Section A1.2.1 The field cropping information collected in the Survey enables separate estimates to be made of nitrogen fertiliser use on milling and non-milling (seed/feed) categories of winter wheat (Table A1.5). The difference between the rates applied to milling and non-milling wheats reflect differences in crop husbandry and nitrogen management practices.

Table A1.5 Average field rates (kg/ha) of nitrogen on cereals by market use, Great Britain 2020 – 2024 Total nitrogen Nitrogen fertiliser requirements for winter wheat depend on the intended market end use (grain N levels), as well as upon soil type and the residual soil nitrogen fertility from previous cropping and manure practice. Milling varieties are often grown as a second wheat and often receive extra nitrogen, either as a solid dressing or as late foliar urea spray, which is applied to improve the chances of achieving an adequate grain protein content for a milling premium.
High yielding feed crops, rather than potentially lower yielding varieties of milling wheat, are often grown as a first winter wheat after a break crop, such as oilseed rape. This is to exploit the potential yield and residual soil nitrogen benefits from the crop rotation, and to avoid any risk of lower grain protein due to a high yield diluting the grain nitrogen concentration for a first wheat in the rotation. The average field application rate on milling wheat increased by 4 kg/ha to 191 kg/ha, and the rate on non-milling wheat decreased by 2 kg/ha to 168 kg/ha compared with 2023. The non-milling crop continues to dominate the wheat crop area (Table A1.6) with 69% of the crop in 2024 (5-year mean: 64%).
Table A1.6 Percentage distribution (% crop area) of cereal crop areas by market use, Great Britain 2020 – 2024, as estimated from the Survey Nitrogen use on Spring barley: Section A1.2.1 Overall application rates of total nitrogen on spring barley increased by 2 kg/ha to 97 kg/ha, which was just under the five-year mean (2020-2024) of 96 kg/ha. The rate of straight N increased by 4 kg/ha to 78 kg/ha whilst the overall application rate of compound N decreased by 1 kg/ha compared with 2023 to 20 kg/ha. The average field rate for straight N decreased by 2 kg/ha and the rate for compound N increased by 2 kg/ha compared with 2023. The percentage of the spring barley area receiving a dressing of straight N decreased by 7 percentage points to 87%, and dressing cover with compound N decreased 4% to 38% (Table A1.3c).

Further analysis of the data by crop type (Table A1.5) shows the average field rate of nitrogen applied to spring malting barley increased by 2 kg/ha to 102 kg/ha, while that for spring nonmalting barley decreased by 1 kg/ha to 98 kg/ha. In the case of the spring malting crop the five-year mean is 101 kg/ha, whilst for non-malting crops the mean is 99 kg/ha.
Estimated nitrogen rates on spring barley crops have been consistently a little higher on malting than non-malting crops. This slightly higher use of nitrogen on malting than nonmalting crops may seem anomalous, since lower rates of nitrogen are recommended for malting barley, under the same conditions of soil type and nitrogen fertility level, than for the feed varieties of barley. This recommendation is made to avoid the risk of high grain nitrogen content, which could adversely affect subsequent malt quality. However, malting crops are normally grown on soils with low nitrogen fertility and the average field rates of nitrogen reported for malting varieties in Table A1.5 are in the range recommended for mineral soil types with low nitrogen residues (70 - 120 kg/ha)3. Feed crops on the other hand are often grown within mixed rotations, which tend to have a higher soil nitrogen fertility, with consequently less need for nitrogen fertiliser.
The proportion of spring barley grown for malting has fluctuated during the last five years (Table A1.6). The mean for the period 2020-24 is 56%, with the lowest proportion recorded in 2020 at 51%.
Nitrogen use on Winter barley: Section A1.2.1 In the period 2002-08 the total nitrogen overall application rate on winter barley decreased from year to year, down to 132 kg/ha in 2008. This rate then increased albeit with some fluctuations to 2017, but in 2018 the rate decreased by 6 kg/ha to 143 kg/ha. In 2024, overall total N application rate decreased by 2 kg/ha to 135 kg/ha. The application rate of straight N, which was used on 92% of the winter barley crop area, decreased to 129 kg/ha in 2024, in line with the five year (2020-24) mean of 129 kg/ha. The compound N overall application rate was unchanged at 6 kg/ha, below the five-year mean of 7 kg/ha.
As with the spring sown crop, nitrogen requirements for winter barley depend on a range of agronomic factors, such as the intended market for the grain. Average field rates of nitrogen on winter malting crops increased by 13 kg/ha compared to 2023 to 138 kg/ha, above the five-year mean of 127 kg/ha. For winter non-malting crops, the average field rate was the same as in 2023 at 144 kg/ha (Table A1.5), the same as the five-year average of 144 kg/ha.
The higher application rates of nitrogen (five-year mean of +17 kg/ha) on non-malting, compared to malting winter barley crops, reflect typical agronomic practice, but the gap between malting and non-malting crops was smaller than in previous years. The majority of winter barley crops (both feed and malting) are grown in England in arable rotations, usually after a previous cereal crop, when the soil nitrogen fertility status is low. Higher nitrogen rates are recommended for feed crops. The proportion of winter barley area grown for malting was 17% in 2024, 2 percentage points lower than 2023, with the five-year mean calculated as 18%. (Table A1.6).
Nitrogen use on Maincrop potatoes: Section A1.2.1 Total nitrogen use on maincrop potatoes has fluctuated over the last five years. Part of the reason for recent apparent fluctuations in the estimates of nutrient application rates may be because proportionally fewer fields of potatoes are covered by the Survey in comparison to 3 Anon. (2018). Nutrient Management Guide (RB209). Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB).

other crops. This is because fields of potatoes on respondents’ farms may be let out and grown by a third party, so it is not possible to record information in the Survey. Furthermore, fields of potatoes grown by a respondent, but not on the farm being surveyed, are not captured in the Survey.
In 2024, the overall application rate of nitrogen decreased by 15 kg to 128 kg/ha, which is below the five-year mean of 135 kg/ha (Table A1.3a).
Nitrogen use on Oilseed rape: Section A1.2.1 In 2024, the nitrogen average field on winter oilseed rape increased to 166 kg/ha, with a fiveyear mean of 165 kg/ha (Table A1.7). The crop area dressed with straight N was unchanged at 98%, and increased by 3 percentage points for compound N (to 13%) (Table A1.3c).
Table A1.7 Average field rates of nitrogen (kg/ha) on winter oilseed rape, Great Britain 2020 – 2024 Nitrogen use on Sugar beet: Section A1.2.1 The overall application rate of nitrogen on sugar beet was the same as in 2023 at 67 kg/ha, just above the five-year mean (66 kg/ha). Application rate of straight N, by far the most widely used form of nitrogen in this crop (five-year mean: 82% of the dressed area), decreased to 60 kg/ha (Table A1.3a, A1.3c). The average field rate of straight N increased to 80 kg/ha, 9 kg/ha above the five-year mean of 71 kg/ha.
A1.2.2 Phosphate and Potash use on Major Crops Phosphate: Section A1.2.2 In 2024, the overall application rate of phosphate on the major crops changed by 1-2 kg/ha except on potatoes and sugar beet. (Table A1.3a). Average field rate changes were small and variable on cereal crops, whereas potatoes and sugar beet recorded a 17 kg/ha increase and a 12 kg/ha decrease respectively. (Table A1.3b). In 2024, the overall phosphate application rate on crops was unchanged at 17 kg/ha (Table A1.2a), below the 2020-24 fiveyear average (19 kg/ha).
Potash: Section A1.2.2 Overall, potash application rate on crops decreased in 2024 by 1 kg/ha to 22 kg/ha, below the 2020-2024 five-year average of 25 kg/ha (Table A1.2a). This decline was due to a reduction in dressing cover of 1 percentage point to 38%. Dressing covers decreased for all the major crops except potatoes, which increased to 91%. (Table A1.3c). Average field rate changes of potash were mainly small and variable, except for potatoes and oilseed rape for which the decrease was 6 kg/ha from 2023. (Table A1.3b).

A1.2.3 Sulphur use on Major Crops The Survey has collected detailed information on sulphur fertiliser use since 1993, when only 3-6% of the cereal crop area and 8% of the oilseed rape area received an application of sulphur. By 1997, the proportions of these crop areas which were treated with sulphur had increased markedly to 13-14% for cereals and 30% for oilseed rape. Dressing covers for sulphur then generally remained fairly static until 2002 when the areas increased steadily until 2007. 2008 saw reductions in dressing covers for cereals to 35%-43%, a pattern that continued in 2009, except in winter barley where sulphur dressing cover increased to 45%.
Between 2010 to 2020, sulphur dressing covers on winter cereals and sugar beet grew significantly, peaking in 2020. Since then, they have been slightly drawing back. In 2024, sulphur dressing cover increased slightly overall, but with a decrease of 3 percentage points observed on winter barley. (Table A1.8). The average field rates for crops were generally higher than in 2023, with spring barley being the exception.
Table A1.8 Dressing cover (% area) and average field rate (kg/ha SO ) of sulphur 3 on cereals and oilseed rape, Great Britain 2020 – 2024 Dressing cover (%) Average field rate (kg/ha SO ) 3 Table A1.9 shows the proportion of major crops receiving a sulphur dressing in England & Wales compared with Scotland. Historically, a higher proportion of cereal and oilseed rape crops were treated with sulphur in Scotland than in England & Wales. This may have been due to the greater awareness of the risk of sulphur deficiency in Scotland due to historically extremely low levels of atmospheric sulphur deposition, compared to most other areas of Britain. Dressing covers are now much more closely aligned and, in some cases, those in England & Wales exceed those recorded in Scotland. Spring barley is an example of this trend, with this possibly being due to the manure which is more commonly applied to this crop in Scotland being assumed to satisfy the sulphur demand. In 2024, 43% of Scottish spring barley received manure compared with 21% in England and Wales.

A1.3 FERTILISER USE ON GRASSLAND 2020 - 2024 Overall application rates on grassland in Great Britain in the last five years, as previously shown (Tables A1.1 and A1.2), are summarised again in Table A1.10. The corresponding estimates of dressing cover and average field rates for each nutrient are shown in Table A1.11.
Table A1.10 Overall application rate (kg/ha) on grassland, Great Britain 2020 – 2024 In 2024, dressing cover for total nitrogen on grass decreased by 2 percentage points to 42% (Table A1.11). The long-term trend had been for declining dressing cover for total nitrogen but 2023 saw a small recovery from the low level reported in 2022 and 2024. In 2024, like 2023 grass dressing covers of straight and compound N were at a similar, albeit low level. The average field rate for compound N was 57 kg/ha while for straight N it was 93 kg/ha. In 2024, the overall application rates for phosphate and potash were 4 kg/ha and 6 kg/ha, respectively (Table A1.10).

Table A1.11 Dressing cover (%) and average field rate (kg/ha) of fertiliser on grassland, Great Britain 2020 – 2024 Dressing cover (%) Average field rate (kg/ha) The proportion of the grass area receiving a straight nitrogen dressing decreased slightly in 2024 to 23% and the compound N dressing cover was at 22% in 2024 (Table A1.11). The dressing covers of phosphate and potash on grass were 21% and 22% respectively. The fiveyear means for 2020-2024 were 27% and 29%, respectively. The sulphur dressing cover increased by 1 percentage point from 2023 to 13% in 2024.
In 2024, the average field rates for phosphate on grass decreased by 1 kg/ha to 19 kg/ha and for potash increased by 2 kg/ha to 28 kg/ha. The sulphur average field rate decreased by 3 kg/ha to 34 kg/ha, the same as the five-year average of 34 kg/ha.
A1.3.1 Nitrogen use on Grassland Cutting and grazing management: Section A1.3.1 Fertiliser requirements for grassland vary according to the type of livestock enterprise, intensity of production and the associated cutting and grazing regimes used for sward management. Fertiliser use on dairy, other livestock, and mixed farms in Great Britain in 2024 are presented in Appendix 2. The Survey estimates of annual distributions of the total grassland area between grazing and cutting management regimes since 2020 are summarised in Table A1.12. These should not be taken as authoritative national estimates of grassland utilisation, as the Survey is designed to estimate fertiliser application rates, not to derive accurate crop areas, although these may still be the best available estimates of grassland utilisation by area.

Table A1.12 Grassland utilisation (% of grass area), Great Britain 2020 – 2024 1 May also be cut, 2 May also be grazed Nearly all grassland is grazed at some stage during the season (Table A1.12) and the proportion in 2024, 93%, is just below the five-year mean of 94%. Nitrogen usage for the different cutting and grazing categories is presented in Table A1.13. The differences in average field rates for nitrogen illustrate the influence of grassland management practice on fertiliser inputs with rates being lowest generally in grass cut for hay, higher in grass which is grazed and higher still in grass cut for silage.

In 2024, the overall total nitrogen rates decreased by 4 kg/ha to 30 kg/ha for grazed grass and by 5 kg/ha for silage grass. The overall nitrogen rate on grass for hay decreased by 3 kg/ha to 32 kg/ha. Rates reported on grass cut for hay need to be treated with caution due to the relatively small numbers of grass fields being managed this way (Table A1.13).
The average field rates of straight nitrogen decreased for both grazed and silage grass. The five-year means for overall straight nitrogen rate are 22, 52 and 20 kg/ha for grazed grass, silage and hay, respectively. Compound nitrogen average field rates all decreased in 2024.
The five-year means for the overall compound nitrogen rates are 17, 33 and 16 kg/ha for grazed grass, silage and hay, respectively.
The fall in nitrogen use over the long term on grassland until 2008 is likely to be related in part to decreases in ruminant livestock numbers which may have reduced herbage production requirements. Since then, the rate of nitrogen application to grassland had remained relatively constant, but the 2024 overall nitrogen rate of 30 kg/ha was considerably lower than the 55 kg/ha reported in 2008.
A1.3.2 Phosphate and Potash use on Grassland As for nitrogen, phosphate and potash requirements for grassland depend on the system of sward management with overall application and field rates for both phosphate and potash being higher in grass cut for silage.
Table A1.14 Phosphate and potash use (kg/ha) by grassland utilisation, Great Britain 2020 – 2024 Total phosphate Total potash 1 May also be cut, 2 May also be grazed In 2024, the overall phosphate rates were unchanged for grazed, silage and hay grass. The corresponding five-year means for grazed grass, silage and hay were 5, 10 and 6 kg/ha, respectively. The average field rate increased by 1-2 kg/ha for grazed and silage grass, and decreased 2 kg/ha on grass cut for hay in 2024.

Overall potash rates increased very slightly in 2024. The average field rate of potash increased by 3 kg/ha on silage grass and decreased by 2 kg/ha on grass cut for hay.
A1.3.3 Sulphur use on Grassland In 2024, 13% of the total grassland area received a sulphur dressing (five-year mean 13% for 2020-24 period). Of this, a higher proportion of grassland cut for silage is treated with sulphur compared to grazed grass or grass cut for hay (Table A1.15). Estimated dressing covers have fluctuated in the past five years, with 2-3 percentage point changes observed in 2024.
The significant proportion of heavier textured soil types which occur in the main grassland farming areas, together with assumed inputs of sulphur from manure applications to grass fields, are among possible influences on the consistently low level of sulphur fertiliser use on grassland.
Table A1.15 Sulphur use on grassland, Great Britain 2020 – 2024 Dressing cover (%) Average field rate per year (kg/ha SO ) 3 1 May also be cut, 2 May also be grazed Estimated average field rates of sulphur application peaked for grazed and silage grass in 2007 at 45 kg/ha and 47 kg/ha, respectively and for hay in 2008 at 47 kg/ha. The average field rate for grazed grass fell back during the 2010s, averaging between 29-35 kg/ha, although 2018 was a notable exception at 37 kg/ha. Silage grass average field rates observed a similar trend, averaging between 23-42 kg/ha over the period. In 2024, compared to 2023 values, average field rates decreased for grazed and silage grass and a 2 kg/ha increase was observed for hay. The five-year means are 32, 38 and 35 kg/ha SO for grazed, silage and 3 hay grassland, respectively (Table A1.15). Note that the average field rates in Table A1.15 are annual totals, not rates per cut.

A2 LONGER TERM TRENDS IN FERTILISER USE FOR GREAT BRITAIN A2.1 Longer term trends in Nitrogen use, from 1983 The BSFP commenced as an integrated British Survey in 1992. Before then, the annual Survey of Fertiliser Practice had been completed separately for England & Wales and for Scotland. Some survey statistics from those earlier surveys have since been collated to report an aggregated series for nutrient use in Great Britain since 1983, when the Survey in Scotland started. All the longer-term data represented in the figures within this section can be found in Appendix 1.
The aggregated data for Great Britain follow a similar pattern to that observed for England & Wales because a large proportion of both the cropping and grassland areas in Britain are in England & Wales. Overall total nitrogen rates for cropping and grassland in England & Wales since 1972 and in Scotland and Great Britain since 1983 are summarised in Table AA1.1. The data for Great Britain are presented graphically in Figure A2.1. Overall, nitrogen use has been consistently higher on crops than on grassland ever since the British Survey started.
Apart from a dip in 1992-93 due to major changes in the Common Agricultural Policy, the overall application rate of total nitrogen on cropping land stayed within the range 140-150 kg/ha, with some wider fluctuations caused by factors such as changes in the crop mix and area or changes in nitrogen applications to specific crops (see Figure A2.3). The estimates for the last five years have fallen outside this range, with the overall application rate of nitrogen on crops for Great Britain being 121 kg/ha in 2024. This rate has recovered from the notable low observed in 2022, which was significantly driven by strong fertiliser prices.
Figure A2.1 Overall application rates (kg/ha) of total nitrogen on crops and grassland, Great Britain 1983 – 2024.
Nitrogen levels applied to grassland have always been lower than those on crops. From 1983 until 1999, the difference was fairly constant, averaging 27 kg/ha. Since 2000, the overall applications made to grass fell consistently relative to those made to crops. If the result from the 2020 survey is excluded, where the replacement of winter cereals and rape by spring 24

barley (see Appendix 3, Table AA3.3.1) resulted in an overall nitrogen rate difference of 68 kg/ha, during the last five years, the average difference in overall nitrogen rate has remained relatively constant at 84 kg/ha.
Data on straight and compound nitrogen for Great Britain are not available for the period 1983-91 when the Survey in Scotland was separate from the one in England & Wales. Figure A2.2 shows the overall application rates of straight and compound nitrogen on crops and grassland. Most of the total nitrogen fertiliser used on crops each year has been applied in straight form. On grassland, since 2009, the overall application rates of straight and compound nitrogen were similar, but with a greater decrease in compound N rate observed in 2022.

A2.1.1 Longer term trends in nitrogen use on major crops Overall application rates of total nitrogen on the main arable crops in Great Britain since 1984 are shown in Figure A2.3.
Figure A2.3 Overall application rates (kg/ha) of total nitrogen on major arable crops, Great Britain 1984 – 2024 A2.1.2 Longer term trends in autumn and winter applications of nitrogen fertiliser The BSFP can monitor the extent to which recommended agronomic advice is adopted. By analysing the timing of fertiliser applications, it is possible to assess the extent to which autumn and winter nitrogen is applied. The standard advice is that autumn nitrogen is not required for winter cereals, as economic yield benefits are rare and such applications are vulnerable to leaching loss. The Great Britain values have remained below 10% of the crop area treated for both winter cereal crops since 2003, with the dressing cover being 5% or below for both since 2021. The area receiving autumn nitrogen is too low for data relating to average field application to be used. Autumn nitrogen at 30 kg/ha is recommended for winter oilseed rape, unless the soil has a high nitrogen fertility, as the crop normally requires more nitrogen than winter cereals during the autumn growth period. Data relating to this commentary can be found in Appendix table AA1.2.
A2.2 LONGER TERM TRENDS IN PHOSPHATE, POTASH AND SULPHUR USE, FROM 1983 Historic annual overall application rates of phosphate, potash and sulphur on crops and on grassland in Great Britain are illustrated in Figure A2.4a and A2.4b, using the data presented in Appendix Tables AA1.3, AA1.4 and AA1.5.

Thereafter the decline in rates became more marked to 2010, with 27

the dip in use in 2009 being caused by a major price increase for the nutrient at that time. The data show that, since 2010, overall application rates of phosphate and potash have remained relatively constant, and rates of 17 kg/ha 22 kg/ha respectively, were recorded in 2024.
Overall phosphate rates on crops have been consistently higher than those recorded on grass.
The overall application rate of phosphate on grassland was highest in 1983, at 28 kg/ha, and then application remained relatively stable at 21-26 kg/ha between 1984 and 1998. Overall application rates declined more rapidly in the period between 1999 and 2009, where the rates were 20 kg/ha and 9 kg/ha, respectively. Since then, until 2021, the overall application rates have remained stable at 7-10 kg/ha, but in 2024, like 2022 and 2023, are below that level.
Overall potash usage on crops declined slightly between 1983 and 1997, with the overall application rates in the 60-68 kg/ha range. Like phosphate, overall application rates reduced at a greater rate after this time to 33 kg/ha in 2009. The potash rate in 2009 was the lowest since 1983 and again was thought to be a reaction to the price of the nutrient. Since then, the overall application rates of potash on crops have gradually declined to 22 kg/ha in 2024.
Compared to crops, the pattern of overall potash application on grassland has been more variable. A net decline was shown between 1983 and 2009; since then the rate has remained within the range of 6-14 kg/ha.
Overall sulphur application rate on crops has increased steadily since 2004 and increased by 1 kg/ha to 29 kg/ha in 2024. On grassland the use of sulphur is much lower, but it too has increased, albeit it at a much lower rate. In 2004 the overall application rate was 2 kg/ha and in 2024 this was 4 kg/ha.
Overall application rates of phosphate and potash applied to crops are approximately three times those used on grassland. However, there is greater use of applied manures on grassland (35% cover) than on crops (27% cover) and grazed grassland also receives manure as it is grazed. Annual overall application rates of sulphur on crops and on grassland in Great Britain since 2004 are illustrated in Figure A2.4b.
On crops, the phosphate dressing cover has declined in all GB countries since 2004.
However, the decline in England and Wales has been much higher (-32 percentage points) in comparison to Scotland, where the reduction was 17 percentage points for the period. Despite this, long-term trend dressing covers have been relatively stable in the last 5 years. On grass, phosphate dressing covers have also declined since 2004, but these too have stabilised in more recent years.
Potash dressing covers follow a similar pattern to phosphate, with a marked decline on crops in England and Wales since 2004, followed by stabilisation during the last 10 years.
Sulphur dressing covers have increased since 2004 on crops in all GB countries. At the start of the period, they were generally higher in Scotland than in England and Wales. In the last five years sulphur dressing covers have plateaued, although in the last four years they were slightly higher in England and Wales than Scotland. Dressing covers on grass are lower than those observed on crops. They have increased since 2004, and in the last five years have tended to be higher in Scotland (mean 18%) than in England and Wales (mean 12%).
The data pertaining to dressing coverage of phosphate, potash and sulphur, on both crops and grassland, can be found in Appendix tables AA1.6b, AA1.6c and AA1.6d.

A2.2.1 Longer term trends in phosphate, potash and sulphur use on major crops Overall application rates of phosphate and potash on the main arable crops in Great Britain since 1983 are shown in Figures A2.5a and A2.5b.
Phosphate use on the main combinable crops has shown a gradual net decline since 1983 (Figure A2.5a). The year 2009 saw more marked decreases in overall application rates due to a spike in fertiliser prices (-10 kg/ha for winter wheat and -13 kg/ha for winter barley). In 2010 overall phosphate rates recovered and there was a period of relative stability between 2010 and 2017, but since then there appears to have been a resumption in the decline. Overall phosphate use has also declined steadily on sugar beet but has recently shown signs of recovery on potatoes (Figure A2.5d).
Potash use on the main combinable crops was relatively stable from 1983 to about the turn of the century. It then went through a period of decline to 2009, followed by relative stability between 2010 and 2017, before a return to apparent decline thereafter (Figure A2.5b). Overall potash application rates were declining steadily on potatoes and sugar beet. However, potash application rates on potatoes noted an increase in 2022 and 2024 (Figure A2.5d).
Overall application rates of sulphur (SO ) on the main combinable crops have increased 3 steadily since reporting of sulphur data began in 1983 (Figure A2.5c). However, these increases plateaued during the 2010s, with 2022 recording a second subsequent year of declining application rates. This downward movement reflects a decrease in the dressing cover of sulphur on these and other crops rather than decreases in the average rates which have been relatively constant and close to the recommended rate for many years (Tables A1.3b and A1.3c).

Figure A2.5d Overall application rates (kg/ha) of phosphate and potash on sugar beet and potatoes, Great Britain 1984 – 2024 A2.3 LONGER TERM TRENDS IN STRAW REMOVAL, FROM 1984 Estimates of the percentage of straw removed from wheat and barley fields are shown in Figure A2.6. Wheat and barley straw contain a significant quantity of nutrients, especially potash. The removal of straw from the field after harvest also removes these nutrients, which would otherwise be returned to the soil when the straw is incorporated. These straws contain on average 1.2-1.5 kg P O (phosphate) per tonne, and 9.5-12.5 kg K O 2 5 2 (potash) per tonne, and it is estimated that for every tonne of cereal grain harvested, 0.5 tonnes of straw can be baled and removed from the field. Thus, the removal of wheat or barley straw will increase the removal of phosphate by about 10% more than if the grain alone were removed, while the amount of potash removed would be approximately doubled.

---
Data collected as part of the 2024 Survey related to the fate of the straw from the 2023 harvest so is reported against 2023. In 2023, 72% of the winter wheat straw was removed from the fields, with the percentages for winter and spring barley higher still at 88% and 92% respectively.
Data for the period 1984-95 were sourced from MAFF/Defra straw disposal surveys, those for the period 2004-21 from this Survey. No data are available for the period 1996-2003. The straw burning ban was introduced in 1993. This resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of straw removed, up to 63% and 93% for wheat and barley respectively, for the 1994 harvest.
A2.4 TOTAL QUANTITIES OF NITROGEN, PHOSPHATE, POTASH AND SULPHUR USED IN THE UK Estimates of quantities of nitrogen, phosphate, potash and sulphur used in the UK since 2003 are illustrated in Figure A2.7. Longer term data, since 2000, can be located in Appendix table AA1.7; nutrient consumption from 1966 is available in the separate BSFP Dataset. These data are based on BSFP findings and trade and sales data. They are compiled by the AIC in conjunction with Defra using the methodology described in Appendix 3.2.5. Users should note that these figures relate also to the whole of the UK, whereas the other figures presented in this report relate just to Great Britain.
Total nitrogen use in the UK increased from 590 thousand tonnes in 1966 up to 1,674 thousand tonnes in 1987 before declining gradually to 1,001 thousand tonnes in 2008.
The drop in 2009 was related to high fertiliser prices. Between 2010 and 2019 nitrogen use has remained relatively stable. The reduction in nitrogen use observed in 2020 was related to weather and cropping factors. From the peak in 1987, UK nitrogen use since has fallen by approximately 40%. Estimated nitrogen use in 2024 increased slightly on the previous year, to 872 thousand tonnes. 2022 was the lowest level seen since 1970, driven predominantly by supply shortage and price increases, in part as a result of the conflict in Ukraine.
Figure A2.7 Quantities of major nutrients used, United Kingdom 2000 – 2024 32


---
Phosphate use in the UK has fallen since the mid-1980s but since 2007 this decline has slowed. The low use of 129 thousand tonnes in 2009 was price related. Between 2010 and 2019 total phosphate use was more stable, between 184 and 201 thousand tonnes. Results for 2020 and 2021 showed a further reduction of this nutrient, (174 thousand tonnes of phosphate was used in 2020). At this level of usage volumes are only 40% of the annual average used between 1966 and 1995. This reduction somewhat reversed in 2024, increasing 14 thousand tonnes on the year, to 116 thousand tonnes. A softening of pricing and supply challenges from the year earlier helped to drive this recovery.
Potash use in the UK was highest in the mid-1980s through to 1999, after which there has been a sustained decline. Potash use in 2022 recorded a steeper decline, following a decade of reasonable stability. This reduced further in 2023 to 184 thousand tonnes. During 2024, potash use recovered to 2022 levels, to 198 thousand tonnes. As with phosphate, an easing in global price increases and reduction in supply issues were key drivers of this recovery.
Between 2009 and 2021, sulphur use recorded a steady increase, reaching highs of 239 thousand tonnes in 2021. This growth was reversed in the subsequent two years, with usage levels of 182 thousand tonnes reported in 2023, the lowest usage volume since 2014.
Sulphur use in 2024 has reversed this downward trend, with usage volumes of 205 thousand tonnes. However, this is still the second lowest volume in the last eight years.

SECTION B USE OF ORGANIC MANURES – GREAT BRITAIN, 2024 Introduction Whilst the BSFP has focused historically on the application of manufactured fertilisers, in the last 15 years it has also collected increasingly detailed information on the use of organic manures. In previous years, farmers were asked where their manure applications fell within pre-specified ‘high’, ‘medium’ and ‘low’ ranges. From 2007, and to better quantify the organic manure data, farmers were asked to provide a specific rate of application which could then be weighted in the same way as the manufactured fertiliser data to deliver a national picture of organic manure usage. However, users should note that the underlying sample design is constructed to measure manufactured fertiliser usage and may not represent the population of farmers using organic manures as robustly.
In this chapter, data on slurries have been collected in cubic metres (m3) and data on solid manures have been collected in tonnes. For the purpose of analysis and presentation, one cubic metre of slurry has been assumed to have the mass of one tonne.
B1 FARMS HANDLING ORGANIC MANURES Organic manures applied to agricultural land may be produced on farm by livestock as slurries, farmyard manure (FYM) and poultry manures, or imported from other sources such as treated sewage sludges (also called bio-solids) and some industrial ‘wastes’ such as compost, paper waste or brewery effluent.
Table B1.1a Numbers and percentage (%) of farms applying each type of manure in Great Britain, 2024 Notes: some farmers may use more than one type of manure.
* Mt (million tonnes) relates to solid manures; Mm3 (million cubic metres) to liquid manures.
** digestate, farm, refers to digestate produced on the farm.
*** digestate, imported, refers to digestate imported onto the farm.

Of the 1,306 farms in the 2024 Survey, 890 used organic manures on at least one field on the farm, representing 63% of the Survey population. The details are shown in Table B1.1a.
Table B1.1b Percentage (%) of farms applying each type of manure in Great Britain, 2020 – 2024 Notes: Prior to 2023, ‘Digestate’, ‘Bio-solids’ and ‘Compost’ were in ‘Other non-farm manure’.
Prior to 2023, ‘Other FYM’ was reported separately from ‘Other farm manure’.
Cattle manure from beef and dairy farms is by far the largest volume of manure type generated in Great Britain. The percentage of farms using cattle FYM and cattle slurry was reasonably consistent over the last 5 years with use in 2024 being 46% and 17% of farms, respectively. Digestate was presented as a category for the first time in 2023 and was used by just under 3% of farms in 2024.

Table B1.1c Dressing cover of organic manure in Great Britain, 2015 – 2024 Dressing cover of organic manure on crops averaged 27% in the five-year period 2020-2024.
The proportions of both categories of grass receiving a dressing of manure were higher than crops in 2024 at 33% on grass 5 years and over and 48% on grass under 5 years old. This was consistently higher than ‘all crops’ over the five years displayed in table B1.1c.
Not all the manure generated by a farm is necessarily retained for use on that farm and excess manure/slurry can be exported for use elsewhere. Up to the 2013 Survey, the report included data on the quantities of manure which were imported onto farm or exported from farms and the number of farms involved. However these were all consistently very low and led to the conclusion that this activity was too small to be of significance or to provide robust data, resulting in collection of these data being discontinued (see 2013 BSFP report, Tables D1.2, D1.3a&b)4.
The percentage of farms that used each type of slurry application method in Great Britain are shown in Table B1.2. This table takes account of all applications whether they are made by the farmers themselves or contractors. These data represent the number of farms rather than volume or area. Band-trailing hose became the most widespread method on cropped fields for the first time in 2024. This is a change from 2023, when broadcasting was the most prevalent method of application. Broadcasting on cropped fields decreased 29 percentage points on the year, to 38% of cropped fields. Farms spreading cattle slurry on cropped fields, by far the largest slurry type by volume, decreased from 72% in 2023 to 42% broadcast in 2024.
Broadcast remained the most widespread method on grass fields as shown in Table B1.2b, albeit demonstrating a 15 percentage point decrease on the year.

Table B1.2b Application methods used by farms applying slurry to grassland, Great Britain 2024. Percentages represent number of farms.
Notes: Cropped (non-grass) fields have been excluded from this table.
* Farms may use more than one application method and may apply more than one slurry type.
** Other surface application methods include by rain gun and by rotating boom.
*** Non broadcast includes band-trailing hose, band trailing shoe, shallow and deep injected.
Whilst some of these application methods (e.g. shallow injection or deep injection) apply slurry below the surface of the field, the majority require secondary cultivation to incorporate the manure/slurry into the soil. Assessment of how often organic manures are incorporated into the soil is complicated by the fact that some farmers make more than one application or apply more than one type of manure and may incorporate each of these differently. As manure on grass fields is seldom incorporated (unless by injection or they are destined for re-seeding), grass fields have been excluded from the incorporation analysis.

Table B1.3 gives estimates of the volume and area of manure/slurry incorporation on cropping fields by manure type and immediacy of incorporation. Farmyard manure is the most extensively incorporated at 97% of the volume applied, with 88% of it incorporated within a week of spreading on cropping fields. Some of the slurries or digestate that are shown as being ‘not incorporated’ could have been applied using a trailing hose (or similar) system.
This would provide mitigation of ammonia loss where it was not possible to incorporate, for example when applied to winter cropped fields in the spring.
Table B1.3 Percentage (%) of organic manure incorporated (area and quantity) on cropping fields by incorporation time and manure/slurry type, Great Britain 2024 Farmers were asked to indicate what proportion of their livestock manures had been spread by a contractor (Table B1.4a). The percentage of farmers using a contractor to spread at least some of their FYM was 25% in 2024. Where contractors were used, they applied between 86% and 95% of the manure on average.

Table B1.4a Use of contractors (%) on farms applying manure to spread manures or slurry in current season, by main manure type, Great Britain 2024 Use of contractors to spread manures was fairly consistent over the five-year period 20202024. An average of 29% of farms (Table B1.4b) used a contractor and they spread an average of 88% of the manure spread on those farms.
Table B1.4b Use of contractors (%) on farms applying manure to spread manures or slurry, Great Britain 2010 – 2024 Historical note: Over four seasons between 2015 and 2019, excluding 2017, the Survey collected data on the periods of storage, and the months of establishment and spreading of manure stored in field heaps. The results seen from these data were considered to be sufficiently indicative of the timings and use of outdoor manure storage that they provided adequate information without the need for continuing collection of these data. The results are available in the relevant previous editions of the Survey5.

B2 USE OF ORGANIC MANURES Recent and current fertiliser recommendations are consistent in their advice to farmers to take note of the nutrient contributions from manures when calculating fertiliser input requirements.
When making comparisons of the data presented in this report several factors should be considered:
 the extent to which individual farmers have accounted for the nutrients in the manures cannot be judged from these data,  the data presented for ‘with/without’ manure are not a paired comparison of otherwise identical fields,  fields which have not received manures may be on farms which have no manure and are thus managed in a different way,  in grassland systems, fields which have not received manures may be managed differently (e.g. grazed only) compared with manured fields which may be cut more than once as well as grazed,  for crops, the overall application rate for manufactured fertiliser is likely, by definition, to include some fields which have received no manufactured fertiliser. For the corresponding ‘with manure’ data, it may indicate that the manure applied was judged to supply all the nutrients required,  for grassland, the average field rate for manufactured fertiliser has been used to avoid distorting the data by inclusion of ‘unmanaged’ grass, which receives no manufactured fertiliser. However, this has the effect of excluding any managed fields on which no manufactured fertiliser was applied because the manure was considered sufficient, thus obscuring any substitution effect,  the dataset of fields where manures are used includes fields which may have received only a very small amount of manure (see section B3). On those fields receiving large dressings, there may be a greater adjustment in mineral fertiliser,  where reductions in phosphate and potash fertiliser have not been made despite an application of manure, this may indicate a desire to build up low soil reserves of these nutrients.
The proportion of the sown area, of all crops plus grassland, receiving each of the main types of manure is shown in Table B2.1a, with cattle FYM and cattle slurry being the most extensively applied manures.

Table B2.1a Percentage (%) of sown area (all crops and grass) that received each organic manure type, Great Britain 2020 – 2024 Note: some areas may have received more than one type of manure in a single year.
The percentage of the sown area that received an application of cattle FYM in 2024 was 15.1%, which is slightly below the five-year average (16.0%).
Table B2.1b Percentage (%) distribution of each organic manure type on all manured crops and grass area, Great Britain 2020 - 2024 Note: some areas may have received more than one type of manure in a single year.
The levels of nutrient in organic manures vary according to which type of manure is being applied as well as factors such as the size, age, gender, and market for the animals that produced it. Furthermore, the concentration of nutrients is dependent on the proportion of incorporated bedding, the length of time that the manure has been stored and, in the case of slurries particularly, diluting factors such as rainwater or dirty water which affect the proportion of dry matter. The BSFP does not ask detailed questions on the animals producing manures or the nutrient analysis of any organic applications made, but it is possible to use typical values for different manure types to estimate the likely nutrient levels delivered. Details of these values are given in Table B2.2.

The majority of cattle manure and slurry applications were made to grassland, reflecting the practice of utilising the manure within the farm on which it is produced. Cattle slurry makes up 85% of all slurry volume (Table B2.3a) and 90% of cattle slurry was applied to grassland. Of the balance, the majority of cattle slurry applied to cropping fields is applied to spring-sown crops (Table B2.4). Data on pig slurry need to be treated with caution due to the relatively low number of farms using manure of this type. Conversely, whilst non-farm manures such as biosolids appear to be favoured on winter-sown cropping land it is notable that a proportion was applied to spring-sown crops. Overall, the 2024 profiles of the % treated area and average manure rates were broadly similar to those reported for 2023.
Table B2.3b Summary of land treated with cattle FYM, by broad crop group and farm type, Great Britain 2024 Notes: Only cattle FYM was applied in sufficient volume to warrant reporting by farm type.
* For Robust Groups see Appendix 5.
** Mt = million tonnes.
*** Percent of total treated areas may not sum to 100% because possible applications to Pig and Poultry Robust Groups are not included.

Table B2.3b shows a breakdown of the cattle FYM applications by farm type. Cereal farms account for the largest proportion of winter sown crop area treated with cattle FYM at 31.3%.
For grass 75.6% of the area treated with cattle FYM was on ‘Other grazing livestock’ robust classification farms.
The time of year when manure was applied is shown in Table B2.4 as a proportion of fields receiving manure applications. Once again, the crops have been classified as either "winter sown", "spring sown" or "grass". This segmentation highlights the importance of different periods through the year for organic manure applications. Whilst there are variations between manure types, the applications that in general made the biggest contributions to the overall manure type totals were early autumn applications on winter-sown crops, and spring and summer applications on both spring-sown crops and grass. When comparing percentage values of different manures, it is important to recognise the very different quantities involved, as indicated by the percentages of treated areas at the foot of the table.

Figure B2.1 Percentage (%) of treated GB areas receiving manure by manure type (3 year average 2022-2024) Note: * No three year average is available for digestate as it was a new reporting category for 2023.
** No direct three year average is available for other farm manure and other non-farm manure due to a change in categorisation owing to digestate being extracted from both and represented as a single category from 2023 onwards.
Figure B2.1 shows the relative volumes of different types of organic manure used in Great Britain. Cattle FYM and slurry supply the overwhelming majority of the area of British crops and grass receiving organic manures.
Figures B2.2a-g are derived from the three-year average of the 2022 to 2024 GB data presented in Table B2.4. Figure B2.2h is derived from the two-year average of the 2023 to 2024 GB data only, not having been collected separately in previous seasons. The proportions of each of these manure types spread onto the winter-sown and spring-sown crops and onto grassland crop groups are shown, together with the timings of applications.
It is important to note that the actual quantities of each manure available for spreading varies very significantly between manure types as illustrated in Figure B2.1. The proportion of the total available manure represented by each type is shown on the individual Figure B2.2 charts.

B3 Fertiliser value of organic manures Organic manures are valuable recycled sources of the major plant nutrients nitrogen, phosphate, and potash and, can theoretically allow applications of manufactured fertiliser to be reduced where organic manures are applied7. While the actual nutrient content of organic manure is rarely known, standard default values are shown in Table B2.2.

In the Survey, farmers were not asked directly whether they had made an adjustment to fertiliser inputs because of manure use. However, an indication of possible adjustments has been derived by comparing fields that received manure with those that did not. Fields used in organic production systems, which use no mineral fertilisers, have been excluded from these comparisons, since they would distort the influence of manures on mineral application rates.
Table B3.1a shows the dressing cover, average field rate and overall fertiliser rates for the main crops in Great Britain, with and without manure inputs.
For all the major crops, except sugar beet and potatoes, the overall application rate of nitrogen from manufactured mineral fertiliser was higher on fields where organic manures were not applied in 2024. The difference in overall nitrogen application rates, with and without manure, ranged from 13 kg/ha for spring barley, 14 kg/ha for winter oilseed rape, to 22 kg/ha for winter wheat and 33 kg/ha for winter barley. The data for potatoes and sugar beet should be treated with caution as these are derived from a small number of fields. The Survey does not collect reasons why manufactured fertiliser application rates may vary when used with or without organic manures. It is possible that certain fields have been managed to achieve a desired nutrient status, and a strategy of this sort may require unusually high or low applications of specific nutrients. Where only a small number of fields are surveyed, such a strategy may exert an influential bias on the overall figures for a crop in the report.
Differences in overall application rates with and without manures for nitrogen, phosphate, and potash for the period 2020 to 2024 are shown in Table B3.1b below. The application of lower rates on manured fields held true for nitrogen for all major combinable crops throughout the period. Overall application rates were lower on manured fields for phosphate and potash on winter wheat in every year from 2020-2024. Other crops show greater variability between manured and unmanured field rates for the different nutrients which may in part be due to the smaller number of fields of each of these crops in the Survey causing higher statistical variability.

Table B3.1b Overall application rates (kg/ha) of manufactured fertiliser application to crops in Great Britain, with and without applications of organic manure, 2020 – 2024 Data for grassland are presented separately because grass is managed differently according to the amount of production required. Intensive milk production requires large volumes of grass and is likely to receive higher inputs of both manure and mineral fertilisers than grass for beef or sheep systems. Table B3.2 shows the average field rate of fertiliser applied to grassland in different management systems (as defined by robust farm type groups) with and without applications of manure. Average field rates have been used for grassland because some grass fields receive no mineral fertiliser, not because of manure use, but because the amount of grass production required does not warrant fertiliser input.

Table B3.2 Average field rates (kg/ha) of manufactured fertiliser application on grassland with and without applications of organic manure by robust farm type group, with number of fields, Great Britain 2024 Cereals Dairy General cropping Mixed Other grazing livestock All farm types Note: The field numbers in "All farm types" exceed the sum of the components in the table as it also includes pig and poultry farms.
* Estimates are based on a small number of observations and should therefore be treated with caution.
When looking at all farm types taken together, the rates of nitrogen fertiliser were mostly higher on fields where manures were also used. This therefore suggests a different relationship between manure and mineral fertiliser than on crops. Different grass fields can have very different productive potentials and thus where a high level of production is expected, and required, the field will receive a considerably higher nutrient input than low yielding fields. Thus both manure and mineral fertiliser will contribute to nutrient inputs to fields with high potential, noting that there is a limit to the permitted application rate of manure.

Mineral fertiliser rates were consistently higher on short term grass than permanent grassland.
The data for certain robust groups, notably cereals, general cropping and mixed farms are derived from relatively few fields, so need to be treated with due caution.
As so many fields on dairy farms receive manure, a separate analysis was carried out to examine the influence of grass management (Table B3.3). All grazing land also receives manure deposited naturally by livestock, but this is not measured as part of the Survey.
Table B3.3 Average field rates (kg/ha) of manufactured fertiliser application on dairy grassland with and without applications of organic manure, with numbers of fields, Great Britain 2020 – 2024 Application rates of nitrogen fertilisers were generally higher for grass to be cut for silage.
Average field rates on grazed grass were higher on those fields receiving a dressing of manure. In 2024 the average field rate of nitrogen on dairy grassland cut for hay was very low, (Table B3.3). It is believed that this is attributable to the small number of fields and varied management practice. Data for grass cut for hay should be treated with caution as the number of fields managed this way is low.
Over the five-year period 2020-2024, mineral fertiliser application rates, whilst variable, were higher for grass cut for silage than other grass management systems.

SECTION C FARMING PRACTICES Farmers were asked a series of questions about the care taken in application of fertilisers and manures and in record keeping. The results are presented in this section.
C1 SPREADER CHECKING In 2024, 65% of farms spread their own fertiliser compared with 71% of farms in 2020. Over the same five-year period the percentage of farms without a spreader has increased to 22% in 2024. Use of contractors has remained in the range of 10-13% of farms since 2020 (Table C1.1).
Table C1.1 Percentages (%) of farms that were without a solid fertiliser spreader, used a contractor to spread solid manufactured fertiliser or owned at least one fertiliser spreader. Great Britain 2020 – 2024 Note: *May add up to more than 100% because those with no spreader may use a contractor.
In 2024, of those farms who had at least one spreader, 56% indicated they check the accuracy of mineral fertiliser spreaders using catch trays on an annual basis (Table C1.2).
Farmers checking more frequently than this comprises 7%, checking at each change of fertiliser. 13% of farmers never check their spreaders for accuracy and a further 2% of farmers considered that spreader accuracy did not need to be checked. Of those farms with a spreader 58% indicated that they used a specific measure to avoid under or over application on headlands, for example, deflector plates.
Table C1.2 Percentage (%) frequency of checking solid fertiliser spread patterns using catch trays on those farms with at least one fertiliser spreader, Great Britain 2020 – 2024 Practices of checking are consistent over the five-year period 2020-2024, although the percentage of farms never checking their spreaders was below the five-year average of 18%.

Farm diaries continued to be the most common method for recording both fertiliser and manure use (Table C2.1), when looking at ‘All farm types’ in 2024. Computers were used for recording fertiliser applications on 36% of farms that applied manufactured fertiliser, representing 48% in area terms. No records were kept on 1% of farms and this was the same when considered on an area basis. Computerised record keeping was less common for organic manures, occurring on 25% of relevant farms. The method of record keeping for ‘all farm types’ was broadly similar for both manufactured and organic fertilisers.
The approach to record keeping varied between different farm types. For manufactured fertilisers, use of computers was highest on ‘cereals’ farms at 46%, and lower at 30% on ‘dairy’ and ‘mixed’ and 13% on ‘other livestock’ farms, where a higher proportion used farm diaries. Farms of all types except ‘cereals’ favoured diaries for recording applications of organic manures.
Table C2.2 Percentage (%) of farms using different record keeping methods, Great Britain 2020-24. Only includes farms where each nutrient type was applied during the crop year.
Note: * Columns may add up to more than 100% because more than one method may be used.
Recording methods for manufactured fertilisers show some variations across the five-year period 2020-2024, with farm diaries remaining the most widely used recording method. For organic manures, records of some type were kept on 93-98% of farms for the five-year period.

C3 SOIL TESTING Table C3.1 Soil testing for different variables: percentage (%) of cropped and grass area tested, Great Britain 2020 - 2024 * Soil sampling for Precision Farming purposes involves taking composite samples from different defined locations in the field, each for individual analysis, to help determine the pattern of nutrient and pH spatial variability within the field.
Table C3.1 shows the percentage of the cropping and grass area that was soil tested for the crop years 2020–2024. It is usual practice, especially for crop fields, to test a sub-set of them in any given year. Standard P, K, Mg, pH was the most commonly used soil test for the period, with an average of 35% of the cropping area and 9% of the grass area. All types of soil tests were more prevalent on crops than on grass, for all years 2020-24.

C4 MITIGATION OF AMMONIA LOSSES Table C4.1 shows the use of solid urea straight nitrogen, liquid urea ammonium nitrate (UAN), or both products, containing urease inhibitors, which reduce gaseous losses of ammonia (a known air pollutant). An ammonia emission inhibitor to mitigate losses of ammonia following the application of a urea-containing fertiliser will usually involve inhibition of the activity of the enzyme urease but can include emission control through physical encapsulation of the solid product or other technology.
Interpretation of the table is not straightforward as the approach to the question was changed and made more specific in 2022. This had the effect of reducing the weighted area (%) attributed to the positive responses and the ‘Don’t Knows’. In 2024, on a weighted area basis, 32% of total solid urea /UAN fertilisers contained an inhibitor. In 2024, 36% of solid urea and 29% of UAN contained a urease inhibitor.

C5 PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS In 2018, 2021, 2022 and 2023 farmers were asked about the professional qualifications they or other relevant people on the farm held and the extent to which they keep them up to date with Continuous Professional Development. The results are shown in Table C5.1. The National Register of Sprayer Operators (NRoSO) qualifies the competence of the holder to operate a farm sprayer. BASIS qualifications demonstrate the competence of the holder to make good agrochemical recommendations. FACTS qualification assesses the competence of the holder to make fertiliser and manure recommendations.
Table C5.1 Professional qualifications held on respondent farms, Great Britain 2018, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 Table C5.2 Percentage (%) of farms maintaining validity through Continuous Professional Development (CPD) of qualifications held, Great Britain 2018, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 The NRoSO continued to be the most popular professional qualification held on respondent farms in 2024 (25% of farms). Of those with a NRoSO accreditation in 2024, 94% of farms kept this up to date with Continuous Professional Development (CPD), which was a slight increase over the percentage reported in 2023. Between 2018 and 2024 there was a slight reduction in the proportion of farms on which no one held any of the qualifications listed.

all farms across 2018, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024. This figure increased to 84-89% when farms with cropping were considered. On farms with grass (which will include farms which specialise in cropping), a veterinary surgeon was the most prevalent source of advice in all years except for 2022 and 2024 where advice from a crop protection agronomist was slightly more popular. The proportion of all farms that did not use any of the listed advice sources was 15% in 2023 and 11% in 2024. Professional advice used on an area basis is presented in Table C6.2.

C7 COVER CROPS Respondents were asked whether they were growing cover and/or catch crops in the crop year 2024. Of those farms with crops, 28% indicated that they were growing cover and/or catch crops during the 2023/24 cropping season. Those holdings who indicated they were growing cover/catch crops were responsible for 37% of the total cropping area in Great Britain (Table C7.1).
Table C7.1 Percentage of farms with crops growing cover and/or catch crops, Great Britain 2024 For the holdings growing cover/catch crops, cover/catch crops were grown on 26% of their cropping area. For Great Britian overall, when cropping farms without cover/catch crops are taken into account, cover/catch crops accounted for 10% of the total cropped area in the 2023/2024 growing season. (Table 7.2).
Table C7.2 Cover crop area as a percentage of holding cropping area and total cropping area, Great Britain 2024 During the crop year 2024, farmers were also asked about their application of secondary and micro nutrients, and the application methods used to apply these nutrients. Further, they were queried on boron application, covering crops, time of application, application method and product. On analysis, it became apparent that no clear data could be provided. Thus, no analysis of these questions appears in this report.

‘Product’ refers to the total tonnage of the products used by the farmers in the survey year 2024.
‘Nutrient’ refers to the tonnage of each nutrient contained in the product used (e.g. 100 kg of a 20:10:10 compound contains 20 kg of N, 10 kg of P2O5 and 10 kg of K2O, while 100 kg of ammonium nitrate (straight N) contains typically 34.5 kg of N).
Estimates of total nutrients are show in in Appendix 3, table AA 1.6.

Table GB5.1, Average fertiliser practice on crops and grassland by River Basin District, Great Britain, 2024 Note: the majority of the Dee River Basin District is included in the Wales data, with the area of the Dee RBD in England being too small to provide usable data. Therefore, English Dee data are incorporated with those few returns not allocated to a River Basin District are not shown separately. See Appendix 6 for a map showing River Basin Districts in Great Britain.

Table EW4.1c, Average fertiliser practice on crops and grassland by River Basin district, England & Wales 2024 Note: the majority of the Dee River Basin District is included in the Wales data, with the area of the Dee RBD in England being too small to provide usable data. Therefore, English Dee data are incorporated with those few returns not allocated to a River Basin District are not shown separately. See Appendix 6 for a map showing River Basin Districts in Great Britain.

APPENDIX 3 – REPORT HISTORY, DEFINITIONS AND METHODOLOGY APP 3.1 INTRODUCTION AND STRUCTURE OF THE REPORT The British Survey of Fertiliser Practice (BSFP) is the primary source of data on organic and inorganic fertiliser use in Great Britain. The results from the Survey are used by the British fertiliser industry, by Government and by the wider agricultural and environmental community.
It is essential that the claims made from the Survey are underpinned by an effective methodology. Section AA2 describes this methodology, detailing measures undertaken to avoid bias and unreliability. National changes in relative cropping areas are discussed in Section AA3.
Section A provides a commentary of recent changes in survey data and longer-term trends. It includes estimates of total fertiliser use which are given in Table AA1.7. These data are derived from BSFP findings, confidential trade and sales data and HMRC import/export statistics. Appendix 2 presents the main tables of results from the Survey, grouped by geographic coverage. They include major crop groups, grassland, product types and farm types plus information on timing of applications. Figures for estimates of 'total', 'straight' and 'compound' nutrient rates are presented in separate tables. Section B provides an analysis of the application of organic manures and manufactured fertilisers. Section C contains more general information on farm practices such as spreader checking, record keeping and soil testing. Datasets for key data series are available via the Fertiliser usage section of the GOV.UK website.
APP 3.1.1 HISTORY The Survey has been in existence, in various forms, since 1942 for England & Wales. It was extended to Scotland in 1983. Historical data from 1942 to 1997 have been summarised in several reviews spanning this period 8, 9, 10, 11. Since 1992 the Survey has reported amalgamated data for Great Britain, in addition to the results for England & Wales and for Scotland. Weighted results for the major combinable crops and grassland were also recalculated from the national surveys to provide additional data for these crops for Great Britain from 1983.
The current methods of survey design and implementation are the result of adaptation of the original design from Rothamsted Experimental Station, undertaken by Edinburgh Data Library at the University of Edinburgh between 1992 and 1998. From 1999 until 2003 design and analysis was undertaken by the Rural Business Unit at the University of Cambridge and from 2004 by Kynetec (formerly GfK Kynetec), who also retained responsibility for conducting the fieldwork. Under Government rules, the contract for the Survey was retendered in 2018 and Kynetec were awarded the contract again.

APP 3.2 SURVEY METHODOLOGY APP 3.2.1 SAMPLE This Survey is based on a sample of holdings in order to reduce burdens and manage resources. The Survey sample is selected from the population of agricultural holdings compiled by Defra and Devolved Administrations using the June Survey of Agriculture and Horticulture (large sample surveys conducted annually at national level which record information on farm size, cropping, stocking and employment, to be referred to as the ‘June Agricultural Survey’). In each year, two samples are extracted from the June Agricultural Survey, one for England & Wales and one for Scotland. The British Survey of Fertiliser Practice only includes holdings with a total area of equal to, or more than, 20 hectares under crops and grass (excluding rough grazing). Section APP 3.2.1.1 illustrates more information regarding minor holdings.
In England & Wales, farms are classified into one of three types, cropping, livestock and horticulture. Farms are then further classified into four size groups. In Scotland, a similar number of size groups are used but farms are classified into only two types, ‘mainly cropping’ and ‘mainly livestock’.
These higher-level farm types are based on groupings of the standard UK farm classifications (called ‘robust’ types). Farms with a robust type of ‘Other’ (robust type 10) are not included in the sample. See APP 3.2.7 paragraph 10 for more details.
In 2024, the target sample size was 1,500 farms. This sample size has been designed to achieve a statistically representative sample at the national level. The number of farms to be sampled is allocated to each of the farm type and size combinations (strata) in proportion to the total area of crops and grass recorded in the June Agricultural Survey (using the latest available data). The exception to this is for horticultural farms in England and Wales, which are sampled at a higher rate to ensure sufficient numbers for a robust estimate to be made.
See Tables AA3.1 and AA3.2 for the number of farms selected.
Where possible, three reserve farms are selected for each farm in the main sample. The reserves will be the geographically nearest holdings (using the County/Parish/Holding (CPH) number) of the same farm type and size group as the farm they are matched to. The Survey is voluntary. Each farm in the main sample is contacted; if for whatever reason a farm is not able to take part in the Survey, the first reserve for that farm is then contacted. If this farm also declines, then the second and if necessary, the third reserve is contacted. If all four farms decline, then no farm is recruited into the Survey for that particular sampling unit.
To help improve the Survey response and to reduce the year-on-year variability, a core of respondents completes the Survey each year. This approach was introduced in 2000, when approximately one third of the sample agreed to stay in the Survey for a number of years.
Between 2006 and 2007 a review of the panel structure was undertaken to ensure that the proportion of respondents who had participated on the panel for five consecutive years or more constituted no more than 20% of the total sample. In 2024, 74% of the panel had responded in the previous year. The profile of the Survey panel in terms of farm size was 78% >200ha, 74% 100-200ha, 66% 50-100ha and 69% >20-50ha.
For the 2024 BSFP the achieved sample size was 1,306 holdings, four more holdings than in 2023. It should be noted that the underlying sample design is constructed to measure manufactured fertiliser usage and may not wholly represent the population of farmers using organic manures, so some of these data, especially where sample sizes are small, need to be treated with appropriate caution.

The sample responses are raised to be representative of the national population by using the inverse of the achieved sampling fraction (i.e. the number of holdings in the population is divided by the achieved sample size in each strata) as the weight. The validity of the derived weights is assessed by calculating a weighted crop area for the most extensively grown crops by this method and comparing this to the latest available crop area estimates from the June Agricultural Survey.

APP 3.2.1.1 Information on minor holdings Holdings with only 20 hectares or less allotted to crops and grass (in total) are excluded from the BSFP sample. These smaller farms account for a significant proportion of the number of holdings but a much smaller proportion of the area of crops and grass. Using the 20 hectare threshold reduces the number of farms which need to be sampled so reducing burdens and costs without significant adverse impact on the survey coverage and hence the quality of the data. Table AA3.2.1 illustrates the scale of minor holdings in Great Britain (2024), enabling an understanding of the scale of minor holdings that are excluded from the survey, and therefore not represented by the statistics in this report.
Minor holdings account for 53% of all agricultural holdings but only 1% of crop area and 8% of grassland.

Table AA3.2.2c Standard errors of application rates for the major crops in Scotland, 2024 The standard errors quoted in Tables AA3.2.2 a-c are a measure of the standard deviation of the mean and are used to judge the accuracy of the results for each cell in the table. This is the standard statistical process where the standard deviation of each cell is calculated first and then divided by the square root of the number of data points within that cell. Approximate 95% confidence limits will be the quoted value +/-2 standard errors.
APP 3.2.2 DATA COLLECTION Data collection was done between July 2024 and February 2025. In addition to collecting information on the fertiliser use on each field, the recorder collected general information on the holding and the use of lime and organic manures and slurries.
Estimated quantities of nitrogen, phosphate and potash fertiliser consumed annually in the UK since 2000 are shown in Table AA1.7. These data are based on BSFP findings, HMRC import/export statistics and confidential trade and sales data which are contributed by Agricultural Industries Confederation (AIC) industry members who represent approximately 90% of the market. They are compiled by the AIC in conjunction with Defra. Further information is provided in Section APP 3.2.5.
APP 3.2.3 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE Experienced and knowledgeable field staff are used to collect the required information. They make use of information from a variety of different records kept by farmers. Farm diaries are the most common method used on farm. Further information is provided in Section C. At data entry, any omitted responses, figures outside pre-agreed limits or other discrepancies are flagged for checking and followed up, often by contacting the survey respondent. Total crop areas reported under this Survey are checked against information held in the June Agricultural Survey. Additionally, 10% of interviews undertaken will be subject to a call back by an 1 36

independent reviewer to check responses to individual questions as part of data quality assurance arrangements. The aggregated figures are checked for consistency and trend analysis against historic data and are subject to independent expert peer review.
APP 3.2.4 ACCURACY AND RELIABILITY OF THE INFORMATION The use of sampling in this Survey means that there will be certain limitations associated with the data. The sampling methodology used is described more fully in Section APP 3.2.1 but essentially uses a random stratified sampling strategy approach, with an element of a core panel, to obtain a representative sample. A response rate of 22% was achieved in 2024.
Sampling errors arise because even with careful selection, the sample cannot be exactly representative of all the population. The size of the sampling error will depend on the size of the sample (the larger the sample the smaller the error) but also on the variance of the data.
An indication of the extent to which the sample result deviates from the population can be obtained from measuring the standard error associated with the data.
The standard errors are relatively small for the grouped ‘all crops and ‘all crops and grass’, and for the main arable crops of wheat, oilseed rape and barley. The standard errors are higher for sugar beet and potatoes where sample sizes (crop area, number of respondents) are smaller.
Figures reported for some of the smaller crops, where the sample size is relatively low, need to be treated with appropriate caution. Sample size information is provided in the tables in Appendix 2 and help to provide an indication of reliability. For crops where the sample size is relatively small it is advisable to use data from several years and to assess trends over a longer period rather than just considering year on year changes.
For potatoes in particular, part of the reason for apparent fluctuations in estimates of nutrient application rates may be because fewer numbers of fields of potatoes are covered by the Survey than would be expected from a sample survey. This is because fields of potatoes on respondent’s farms may be let out and grown by a third party, so it is not possible to record information in the Survey. Furthermore, fields of potatoes grown by a respondent, but not on their own farm, are not captured in the Survey.
The statistics on the pattern of fertiliser practice reported for Great Britain largely reflect practice in England and Wales due to its greater area of total crops and grassland: about 8.7 million hectares in England and Wales and about 1.9 million hectares in Scotland. The estimates of the average field rates provide a better indication than overall application rates of actual usage levels and also of any annual variation in fertiliser practice on farms. The overall application rate considers both the average field rate and the proportion of the crop area treated, giving an overview of the crop in total. The definitions of the terms used are set out in Section APP 3.2.7 of this report.
Additionally, the Survey design has been constructed to measure use of manufactured fertilisers, thus may not be wholly representative of manure use. Some of these data, especially where sample sizes are small, need to be treated with caution.
APP 3.2.5 METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATES OF TOTAL UK FERTILISER USE Estimated quantities of nitrogen, phosphate and potash fertiliser consumed annually in the UK since 1974 are shown in Table AA1.7. These data are based on BSFP findings, HMRC import data and confidential trade and sales data which are contributed by AIC industry members 1 37

who represent approximately 90% of the market. They are compiled by the AIC with input and peer review by an expert group convened by the AIC and in liaison with Defra.
It would be possible to use BSFP data alone to estimate total fertiliser use by taking the average rate for each individual crop and multiplying by the June crop area estimate and summing these to give an overall usage. However, the relatively low coverage of the BSFP survey for some crops, means that the alternative approach of combining BSFP data with trade and sales data provides more robust total usage estimates than using BSFP data alone.
This method also considers use on small farms (<20 ha) and use in Northern Ireland.
The AIC survey their relevant members (15 businesses) monthly to collect information on fertiliser deliveries. The BSFP fertiliser statistics published and used in the industry and agricultural sector are by fertiliser year (growing season, July to June), not by calendar year.
They are available at the AIC website.
Individual returns are quality assured by trend analysis against historic data and also against the aggregate trend. Any omitted data or anomalous figures outside trend or other pre-defined limits are checked and followed up, usually by contacting the survey respondent.
The AIC also purchase monthly HMRC trade statistics on imports and exports of fertilisers; these data are actively used and scrutinised, and where appropriate challenged by the trade.
Twice a year, in December and June, and on an annual basis, aggregated figures for total fertiliser deliveries for the main types of fertiliser are calculated, together with nutrient contents. These are assessed with the import and export figures to derive the base total fertiliser usage figures. The N:P:K ratio from the BSFP Survey is compared with the AIC derived figures to confirm the nutrient quantities relative to each other. Further small adjustments may be made based on other confidential information on stocks or non-fertiliser use of imported urea.
These AIC usage figures are compared to usage figures derived from BSFP and June Agricultural Survey crop area figures and the relationship between the ratios of N, P and K from both sets of data are checked and compared. Any inconsistencies or anomalies identified in the data are identified and followed up and any necessary corrections are made to ensure comparability and consistency across all data.
Each year the AIC figures are reviewed, and quality assured for credibility and consistency across sources by a group of experts contributing knowledge on production, use and trade.
The final agreed aggregated total UK usage figures are subject to independent peer review and checked for consistency and trend analysis, considering known agronomic and market factors.
The total fertiliser use is then split by country. The figures for Northern Ireland are taken from their fertiliser survey and the remaining GB figures are split between England plus Wales and Scotland by applying the proportions derived from the BSFP data. The NI Survey provides data by quarter, amalgamated by calendar year.
APP 3.2.6 REVISIONS The figures presented in this report are finalised.
We will provide information on any further revisions we make to the report or the datasets if any inaccuracies or errors occur.

APP 3.2.7 DEFINITIONS OF TERMS 1. For the purpose of the Survey, the term Great Britain (or Britain) is defined to cover England (including the Isle of Wight), Wales (including Anglesey) and mainland Scotland.
2. The survey year (which is the same as the crop year) ran from autumn 2023 to autumn 2024, corresponding to the 2024 crop year and 2024 harvest. The recording period for fertiliser applications made during this growing season varied for different crop and grass groups.
3. For the purposes of this Survey, a field is defined as any single area of land measuring more than 0.2 ha (half an acre) which had a uniform cropping and fertiliser history from autumn 2021. For data collection and processing purposes, separate fields with identical cropping and fertiliser management on the same farm are blocked together as one ‘field’, to represent the total combined area of those fields. Areas within the same natural boundary receiving different treatments (crops and fertilisers) were recorded separately. Fallow land has always been collected by the Survey, but is not included in the calculations of this report.
4. In the report, Crops are defined as all crops except grass, glasshouse crops and uncropped land. Grass refers to all forms of grassland which may be grazed, conserved, or grown for seed production; rough grazing is excluded.
5. The abbreviation N is used for nitrogen, P O for phosphate, K O for potash, SO for 2 5 2 3 sulphur, and FYM (Farm Yard Manure) for all types of organic manure e.g., slurries and solid manures. The phrase total use includes both straight (single nutrient) and compound (multi nutrient) products. Fertiliser products containing nitrogen and sulphur only are classified with straight nitrogen. Rates are expressed in terms of the equivalent nutrient content, taking into account the nutrient content in the product used. The nutrient content of the common fertiliser products including the dry matter content and nutrient content of various organic manures used are given in the Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) which is available at https://ahdb.org.uk/nutrientmanagement-guide-rb209.
6. The average field rate is a measure of the fertiliser nutrient application rate over the sown area of fields that received some dressing of that nutrient. Average field rate is measured in kilograms of nutrient per hectare (kg/ha).
7. Dressing cover is the proportion of the sown area that has received any application of the nutrient or a manure and is expressed as a percentage.
8. The overall application rate is a measure of the fertiliser nutrient application rate over the sown area of all fields, irrespective of whether they received dressing of that nutrient or not. Overall application rate is measured in kilograms of nutrient per hectare (kg/ha). The overall application rate is calculated by multiplying the average field rate by the percent dressing cover. The overall application rate is always less than or equal to the average field rate due to the inclusion of any area that has not received an application of the nutrient in the calculation of the overall application rate.
9. Sown area is the area of a field that has been planted with a crop or grass. It excludes headlands, field margins, buffer strips and other agri-environment features.

10. The UK farm type system, aggregates a wide range of defined farm types into ten 'robust' types:
(1) Cereals (2) General Cropping (3) Horticulture (4) Specialist Pigs (5) Specialist Poultry (6) Dairy (7) Cattle and Sheep (LFA) (8) Cattle and Sheep (lowland) (9) Mixed (10) Other Individual farms are allocated a particular farm type according to the SGMs (Standard Gross Margins) applied to the farm’s activity as recorded by the June Agricultural Survey. SGMs are a set of coefficients which estimate a £ value for one hectare of each crop or one head of livestock.
Prior to 2004, the UK agricultural departments amalgamated the robust types ‘Specialist Pigs’ and ‘Specialist Poultry’ as the single robust type ‘Pigs and Poultry’.
2006 was the first year that the BSFP adopted the revised classification following analysis that showed this would not lead to under-representation of either of these farm types through marginalisation. The composition of ‘robust’ types is presented in greater detail in Appendix 5. The sampling framework outlined in Section AA3.2.1 can be related to robust types as set out below. Revisions to the definitions of farm types can be found at the following link:
https://w.gov.uk/structure-of-the-agricultural-industry-survey-notes-and-guidance Data presented in Appendix 2 tables GB4.1 to GB4.5 are derived from the robust types shown below.
These robust type groupings are also used in tables B2.3b, B3.2 and C2.1. Due to the small number of specialist pigs and poultry farms interviewed in the Survey, data collected from these robust types have not been presented in any of the tables listed above.
11. Regional analysis of the Survey data for England was classified in two ways in 2024.
Appendix 2, Table EW4.1a is based on the Government Office Regions (GORs) in common with other Defra surveys. Appendix 2, Table EW4.1b is based on the former MAFF (Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food) administrative regions, which were revised in 1996 to take account of changes to county boundaries and nomenclature resulting from the introduction of Unitary Local Authorities between April 1995 and April 1998. These revised regions, termed BSFP regions, have been the basis for regional analysis within the Survey historically and are detailed in Appendix 4.

APP 3.2.8 TYPES OF FERTILISER Of the 16 essential plant nutrients, the four key ones required in relatively large amounts for crops to achieve their optimal yield potential are nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and sulphur. Where nutrients are not available in sufficient quantity in the soil, fertiliser products are applied to supply the nutrient needs of the plant. Plant roots take up the nutrients dissolved in the water in the soil. The nutrients must be in the correct chemical form so that they are in a suitable water-soluble form for plants to be able to use them.
There are two broad types of fertiliser. Manufactured fertilisers tend to be relatively concentrated and supply essential nutrients in a mineral form which usually are immediately available for plant use. The other type is organic fertilisers which can be plantor animal-based, such as manure, slurry, compost, or poultry litter. Organic fertilisers are in their natural form or have undergone minimal processing. They are usually less concentrated than manufactured fertilisers, and often the nutrients they contain may need further breaking down in the soil by bacteria and other soil organisms before they are in a form available to plants. The chemical composition can vary greatly, and they tend to be slower acting and less predictable in their action.
Nitrogen is important for building DNA and proteins in plants. It encourages growth of stems and leaves by promoting protein and chlorophyll. Provided there are adequate supplies of water and other nutrients, nitrogen usually has a large effect on crop growth, yield and quality. Whatever the source, to be usable in the soil by plants, it must be in the form of inorganic ammonium or nitrate ions. The main forms of inorganic nitrogen fertilisers are ammonium nitrate, urea, ammonium phosphates, and ammonium sulphate.
Phosphorus is essential for photosynthesis and respiration. It promotes early root formation and growth and enhances seed and fruit production. It is also important for energy production and storage. In the context of fertilisers, it is measured and defined as P O Phosphate fertilisers include ammonium phosphate and superphosphate. The 2 5.
majority of phosphorus in most soil is in essentially insoluble forms, and unavailable to plants. Phosphorus is very immobile in soil, and the forms that are created and their availability, are dependent on factors such as the soil pH, temperature, and moisture.
Plant roots take up nearly all phosphorus as either the primary or secondary orthophosphate anion (H PO - or HPO -2, respectively). Generally, the maximum 2 4 4 availability of phosphorus occurs in soils within a pH range of 6.0-7.0.
Potassium contributes to many plant functions apart from managing the water status, including shoot and root tip growth, cell extension, photosynthesis and the reduction of drought and disease stress. It is used in the process of building and transporting starches, sugars, and proteins, so is important for grain and fruit yield. Potassium chloride (commonly called muriate of potash) is the most common form of potassium fertiliser used in agriculture. Other forms include potassium sulphate, potassium magnesium sulphate and potassium nitrate. In the context of fertilisers, it is measured and defined in this Report as K O. It is usually taken up from the soil in greater quantities than the other main 2 fertilisers. Crops which are harvested green such as grass and green vegetables will remove relatively large quantities of potassium from the soil.
Sulphur is an essential plant nutrient. It is a component of most proteins and it activates certain enzyme systems. In the past sulphur demand was satisfied through atmospheric deposition. With the significant decline of sulphur from the atmosphere, there is a need for sulphur application to crops and grass and it is often applied together with nitrogen fertilisers. Crops such as oilseed rape are particularly sensitive to sulphur deficiency and so require a relatively high input of sulphur. It is measured and defined in this Report as SO .

APP 3.3 GENERAL TRENDS AND ISSUES APP 3.3.1 CROP AREAS AND WEATHER CONDITIONS Annual changes in relative cropping areas, as well as any changes in fertiliser practice for individual crops, may affect nutrient application rates when aggregated across the main crop groupings. Table AA3.3.1 provides a summary of June Agricultural Survey estimates for areas of individual major crops, crop groupings and total crops and grassland categories in 2023 and 2024 and illustrates percentage changes in relative cropping areas over the past five years. In Great Britain in 2024, 10.5 million hectares were used for either crops or grassland (excluding rough grazing). Of this, 40% (4.2 million hectares) was crops, with the remaining 60% (6.3 million hectares) being grassland.
The crop areas in Table AA3.3.1 refer to the only the sown area of fields, as do the results of the BSFP. Field margins, buffer strips and other agri-environment features are included in ‘Bare fallow’ in Table AA3.3.1.

Comparing the 2023 and 2024 crop years, the area sown to cereals remains largely consistent. There was an 11% reduction in the wheat area and a 19% increase in the spring barley area. The oilseed rape area decreased with continued difficulty in managing pests in this crop. The sugar beet and the potato areas increased, with bare fallow unchanged between the 2023 and 2024 crop years.
Unusual seasonal weather conditions can influence fertiliser usage in some years. For example:
 A very wet (or very dry) autumn might delay the establishment of winter sown crops or alter the ratio of winter to spring sown crops, with their different fertiliser requirements.
 Prolonged wet weather can increase leached losses of some nutrients, particularly nitrogen and sulphur. Weather conditions also affect other aspects of soil chemistry and nutrient availability.
 Adverse weather conditions can disrupt planned activities, such as fertiliser spreading.
 Growing conditions determine plant growth and can therefore affect nutrient requirements.
Figure AA3.3.1 Monthly rainfall as a percentage of the long-term average12 Autumn 2023 was warmer and wetter than average. Settled weather in early September brought many warm, dry and sunny days with a significant late season heatwave. October was unsettled and a very wet month. Much of eastern Scotland, eastern England and south east England saw well over twice the average monthly rainfall. Four named storms affected the UK between late September and mid November and flooding impacted all three nations.

The winter was milder than average overall, but very variable with cold wintry spells in early December and mid January. December and January saw turbulent, unsettled weather with storms in both months. High pressure became established in mid January bringing sunny dry conditions and a marked drop in temperature. The end of the month saw a return to stormy conditions and February was mild and wet.
Spring was warm, unsettled, very wet and dull with a succession of low pressure systems bringing wind and rain. Overall, this was provisionally the warmest spring on record for the UK. There was a cold start to March with snow in the south west of England. It was a wet season with heavy rain in southern and central England during March, in northern England and Scotland during April and across the country during May.
Summer was cooler than average with northerly winds bringing cold Arctic air to the UK in June and July. Scattered showers brought some rain in June, but overall accumulations were below average. August began with thunderstorms in southern England and storm Lilian brought heavy rain and strong winds to northern England, Wales and parts of Scotland.
2023/2024 saw the most named storms since the naming system was introduced in 2015. It was the coolest summer since 2015, but summer rainfall was average for the UK as a whole13.
