FARMING & LAND MANAGEMENT English Farming Update Spring 2024 STRUTT & PARKER’S KEY POINTS AND SUMMARY FARMING OVERVIEW Alice Johnson Associate Director Welcome to this quarter’s Farming Update, which is alice.johnson@struttandparker.com produced by our Farming Research Group and reports 01609 780306 on market and administrative issues that affect farmers’ business decisions and on which they may need to act.
Defra secretary Steve Barclay used the 2024 Oxford Farming Conference as a platform to launch an update of the Agricultural Transition Plan. The headlines include a further increase in payment rates for Countryside Stewardship (CS) and the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) by an average of 10%, with some new .premium payments being introduced to encourage farmers to embrace 21 priority actions.
The Improving Farm Productivity Grant online checker has opened. The grant will pay for capital items that use robotic and automated equipment to aid livestock and crop production, along with the installation of solar equipment.
Arable prices as shown in the market update have fallen around 15% since this time last year. Lower prices will mean significantly reduced profitability for grain and oilseed farmers in 2024.
We have updated our arable farmprofitabilitymodel using current market data to produce revised forecasts for harvest 2023 and harvest 2024. The net margin for an average performing arable farm for harvest 2024 is expected to be £258/ha (£208 in 2023) and for a higher performing farm it is expected to be £475/ha (£416/ha in 2023).
Please contact our team for further information on anything you read here.
DATES FOR THE DIARY • 1 December 2023 to 30 June 2024 –RPA makes final 2023 BPS payments and CS/ES revenue payments • 21 March 2024 –Improving Farm Productivity grant round 2 –online checker closes • 15 May 2024 –CS revenue claim deadline 1

GLOBAL GRAIN MARKET • European markets have been pressured by intense competition from the Black Sea region, only partly offset as the euro continued to weaken against the US dollar.
• Conflict in the Red Sea has increased the competition for grain sales in North Africa and Europe.
• Access to the Asian markets, which usually import Russian and Ukrainian grain, has been compromised, bolstering Black Sea supplies and weighing on European grain markets.
• Ukraine’s export capabilities have been improved since the country established an alternative Black Sea corridor. Since 1 July 23 to 19 January 24, EU soft wheat exports are down 7.6% from this period last season at 17.4 Mt, while barley exports report a modest 0.4% increase at 3.3 Mt.
• Argentina is now able to export wheat to China following approval from Chinese customs. This could increase current competition for French wheat as China has been a key export destination in recent years.
• Recent rains in east and south Australia have improved the crop production outlook, which had been pressured by hot and dry conditions caused by the El Niño weather event. Wheat production could reach 30Mt according to some forecasters, 20 -25% above latest official estimate.
UK WEATHER Not much has changed from our previous Winter issue; rain and storms continue to affect agriculture. There is still a large area of arable crops to be established due to waterlogged and flooded fields.
Climate change is, as expected, leading to an increase in extreme weather. The Met Office highlighted that 2023 was provisionally the second warmest year on record in the UK. There records also show that the UK is getting wetter, and heavy rainfall exceeding 50mm has become more frequent in the autumn. A warmer, moister atmosphere increases the capacity for deluges of rain, which can result in serious flooding, as we have seen across the regions.
Source: Met Office S&P COMMENT Arable prices highlighted in the market update are around 15% below 2023 prices. Prices have fallen in comparison to last year due to more favourable global production prospects in comparison to summer 2023, and more competition from Ukrainian and Russian wheat. Lower prices mean significantly reduced profitability for grain and oilseed farmers in 2024.
UK weather continues to affect arable production, farmers have struggled to get their winter crops drilled due to flooding and waterlogged fields. This means farmers are looking at alternative options such as spring cropping or SFI environmental options. There is a however, a shortage of spring seed, with a large proportion of spring seed already sold out and what is left selling at a premium inflated rate.

For the full year of 2023, the UK produced 927,400t of pig meat, an 11% year on year decline and the lowest annual volume recorded since 2018. • Carcase weights have been lower throughout 2023 compared to 2022, averaging at 89.1kg. However the predominant driver in reduced pig meat production comes from a sharp fall in the number of pigs slaughtered, not weight. • Clean pig kill numbers in 2023 fell 10% year on year to 10.06 million head, the lowest annual clean pig kill in a decade (in 2013 the UK clean pig was 10.05 million head).                  |
| S&PCOMMENT Livestock production 2023 volumes highlighted by AHDB declined across lambs, beef, dairy and pigs. Weather continues to be highlighted as a one of the main reasons for the declines in carcase weights for both lamb and beef. The rising costs of living is predicted to reduce the demand of lamb and beef consumption in 2024 due to tighter consumer budgets. Beef prices are predicted to keep firm in the UK, partly due to Ireland forecasting a 4% reduction in their beef production for 2024, which will limit their scope for exports to the UK. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

FERTILISER & FUEL Fertiliser • UK produced Ammonium Nitrate has dropped in price to around £330/T (from £370/T in November), which will benefit those farmers who are yet to buy their spring requirements. This sees AN prices fall back into line with the global urea market.
• Nitrogen fertilisers will continue to react to natural gas prices, however there are ample natural gas supplies on the continent, which should keep some price stability in fertiliser markets short term.
Fuel • The average price of crude oil stands at $79/barrel (December 2023), a $5.92/barrel reduction compared to November 2023.
• Red diesel prices have slightly reduced since our previous winter update to around 83p/l in December 2023, (a 23p/l decrease compared to the same time last year).
Source: FW & AHDB FARM BUSINESS NEWS Medium-term drivers of farm production in Europe The EU has published a report on the main drivers expected to affect farming in the region in the medium-term to 2035. They are:
• A continuing, but slower, increase in farm size. In the past, this has led to growth in farm productivity.
• Climate change and its impacts on key natural resources like water and soil. It is expected to reduce growth in yields and could lead to changes in crop cultivation patterns.
• Continuing changes in consumer demand.
These are expected to include lower meat consumption, especially of beef and pork; dairy product consumption is expected to be stable; and increases in consumption of some plant proteins, such as pulses. These changes are expected to lead to a stable area used for arable production but a switch in the arable crops grown, from cereals to soya beans and pulses. The area used for animal production is also expected to be stable, due to more extensive farming systems offsetting the expected reduction in livestock numbers.
Defra revises SFI and CS payments and options for 2024 Defra secretary Steve Barclay used the 2024 Oxford Farming Conference as a platform to launch an update of the Agricultural Transition Plan, focusing on changes to incentivise more farmers to sign up to an agrienvironment scheme. The headlines include a further increase in payment rates for Countryside Stewardship (CS) and the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI), with some new premium payments being introduced to encourage farmers to embrace 21 priority actions. Mr Barclay called his announcement ‘the biggest upgrade to the UK’s farming schemes since leaving the European Union’.

Updated arable farm profit forecasts for harvest 2024 We have updated our arable farmprofitabilitymodel using current market data to produce revised forecasts for harvest 2023 and harvest 2024. The modelling tool uses a set of universal assumptions toprovide an outlook for the sector. The analysis shows that the net margin –which can be considered to be the equivalent ofprofit, before rent and finance –for an average performing arable farm for harvest 2024 is expected to be £258/ha. This is higher than the estimate for harvest 2023 (£208/ha) owing mainly to higher grain prices currently available for 2024 crops compared with 2023 crops. The model shows that higher performing businesses can expect much better results than the average performing businesses (£475/ha for 2024) due to higher yields and lower fixed costs.

The requirement to deliver BNG will apply to most planning applications, apart from those under deemed permission or a Local Development Order. As might be expected, conservation organisations have been critical of the delays to its introduction, saying that the failure to plan for the policy properly is an indication of how the government is prioritising the environment. Please speak toAlex Brearley, our head of Natural Capital, if you would like to discuss BNG.
Proposed planning reforms would boost the rural sector There has long been a feeling that the planning regime has stifled economic growth in the countryside. So, it is encouraging that the Government is now recognising the importance of planning reforms which will support and boost the rural economy. Since the introduction of national Permitted Development (PD) rights, farmers and landowners have had greater opportunities to convert, expand and build on their land. We have many clients who have used these rights to diversify and generate alternative income without the requirement for a full planning application. However, there have been frustrations about some of the limitations. A consultation launched in July 2023 by the Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities proposes beneficial changes to PD rights for farms and rural businesses, including increasing the limits on conversions to housing and allowing greater flexibility to encourage farm efficiency and diversification. We await the Government’s response to the consultation with anticipation.

As the number of cars has increased, so has the number of chargers available just not by enough.
The Government’s target is for 300,000 public chargers to be available by 2030, but Zap- Map, a website which tracks the rollout of charging devices, estimates there were just 48,450 electric vehicle charging points across the UK at the end of August 2023. While this represents a 42% increase in the total number of charging devices since 2022, there is still clearly a long way to go. This provides an opportunity for landowners with property close to major road networks and for landlords of rural commercial buildings.
