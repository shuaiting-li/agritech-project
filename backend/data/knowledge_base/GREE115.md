Using the Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) Using the Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) Section 1 Principles of nutrient management and fertiliser use This latest revision of RB209 is based on research carried out since the Section 2 Organic materials previous edition was published in 2010. The revision includes updated Section 3 Grass and forage crops recommendations, including those for additional crops and information on the nutrient content of additional organic materials. Section 4 Arable crops RB209 was first published in 1973 and was the first comprehensive set of Cereals fertiliser recommendations from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Oilseeds (MAFF). RB209 stands for Reference Book 209.

| Light sand soils  | Soils which are sand, loamy sand or sandy loam to 40 cm depth and are sand or loamy sand between 40–80 cm, or over sandstone rock.                                                                                                                                            | Soils in this category have poor water holding capacity and retain little nitrogen.                                           |
| Shallow soils     | Soils over impermeable subsoils and those where the parent rock (chalk, limestone or other rock) is within 40 cm of the soil surface. Sandy soils developed over sandstone rock should be regarded as light sand soils.                                                       | Soils in this category are less able to retain or supply nitrogen at depth.                                                   |
| Medium soils      | Mostly medium-textured mineral soils that do not fall into any other soil category. This includes sandy loams over clay, deep loams, and silty or clayey topsoils that have sandy or loamy subsoils.                                                                          | Soils in this category have moderate ability to retain nitrogen and allow average rooting depth.                              |
| Deep clayey soils | Soils with predominantly sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay or clay topsoil overlying clay subsoil to more than 40 cm depth. Deep clayey soils normally need artificial field drainage.                                                      | Soils in this category are able to retain more nitrogen than lighter soils.                                                   |
| Deep silty soils  | Soils of sandy silt loam, silt loam or silty clay loam textures to 100 cm depth or more. Silt soils formed on marine alluvium, warp soils (river alluvium) and brickearth soils are in this category. Silty clays of low fertility should be regarded as other mineral soils. | Soils in this category are able to retain more nitrogen than lighter soils and allow rooting to greater depth.                |
| Organic soils     | Soils that are predominantly mineral but with between 10–20% organic matter to depth. These can be distinguished by darker colouring that stains the fingers black or grey.                                                                                                   | Soils in this category are able to retain more nitrogen than lighter soils and have higher nitrogen mineralisation potential. |
| Peat soils        | Soils that contain more than 20% organic matter derived from sedge or similar peat material.                                                                                                                                                                                  | Soils in this category have very high nitrogen mineralisation potential.                                                      |

Fertiliser use for fruit, vines and hops Soil acidity and liming On soils where acidity is known to occur, soil may need to be tested more frequently than the four year cycle used for phosphate, potash and magnesium.
Most fruit crops are tolerant of slight acidity and grow best at around pH Since acidity can occur in patches, spot testing with a soil indicator across the 6.0–6.5. Soil pH levels below about 5.5 can give rise to manganese toxicity, field is often useful. Soil indicators can also be useful on soils which contain causing ‘measley’ bark in apples and purple veining in some strawberry fragments of free lime, since these can give a misleadingly high pH when varieties. Blackcurrants are more susceptible to soil acidity and a pH of at least analysed following grinding in the laboratory.

Mature hops can tolerate a considerable degree of soil acidity but some varieties may suffer from manganese toxicity if the soil becomes too acidic.

The correction of acidity in undisturbed soil is slow, so it is important to check soil pH regularly and apply lime when necessary before the soil becomes too Liming before planting acidic and a severe problem builds up.
Any lime required should be applied and incorporated before planting, see Liming materials Section 1: Principles of nutrient management and fertiliser use. Because acidity problems occur in patches and acidity can develop rapidly when Acid soils deficient in magnesium may be limed with magnesian limestone, herbicides are used, the whole plough layer should be limed to maintain a pH particularly before planting. One tonne of magnesian limestone contains at least value of 6.5 in the early years of fruit or hops. It will be impossible to correct 150 kg MgO. However, over application of magnesian limestone can reduce the any acidity at depth by later lime incorporation so the quantity of lime applied availability of soil potash. Where soil magnesium levels are satisfactory, ground before planting should be calculated to correct the pH of the top 40 cm of soil.

Fruit, vines and hops – before planting Fruit, vines and hops – before planting Table 7.3 Nitrogen, phosphate, potash and magnesium for fruit, vines and hops before planting Nitrogen is not required before planting fruit crops but can be beneficial before planting potted hop cuttings. Where soil analysis before planting shows soil acidity or low soil P, K or Mg Indices, it is important to correct these shortages by thorough incorporation of appropriate amounts of lime and fertilisers.
After planting, the downward movement of all nutrients from the soil surface is slow, except for nitrogen. This applies particularly for phosphate and to a lesser extent for potash and magnesium. In organic production systems, soil fertility must be built up prior to planting.
Where previously ploughed land has been sampled to 15 cm depth only, the recommended amounts of phosphate, potash and magnesium should be thoroughly incorporated in the autumn before planting. Before planting top fruit, vines or hops, if soil analysis shows the field to be at P, K or Mg Index 0 or 1, the appropriate nutrient quantities should be ploughed down. Then the same amount of nutrients should be applied again and thoroughly incorporated before planting. If the plough depth is less than 20 cm, the amount ploughed down should be halved.
Where samples have been taken from 0–15 cm and 15–30 cm depths, the recommended rate based on the 15–30 cm sample should be ploughed down before top fruit, vines or hops are planted if the soil P, K or Mg Index is 0 or 1.
After ploughing, the amount based on the 0–15 cm sample should be applied and thoroughly incorporated. If the plough depth is less than 20 cm, a.

Top fruit, established orchards Table 7.4 Nitrogen for established top fruit Table 7.5 Phosphate, potash and magnesium for established top fruit a. Pears require approximately an additional 70 kg KO/ha up to Index 3 but no addition at Index 4.
2 Cider apples also respond to larger applications rates of potash.
For apples, soil K Index should not be built up above 2 because excessively large potash applications can adversely affect storage quality. To avoid inducing magnesium deficiency, the soil K:Mg ratio (based on soil mg/litre K and Mg) should be no greater than 3:1. Where the yields of apples and pears are regularly above 40 t/ha, maintenance applications of potash may need to be increased by 20 kg K O/ha for every additional 10 t/ha in yield.
2 For established crops, the timing of phosphate, potash and magnesium application is not critical. If the nutrient Index is 2 or over, the nutrients may be applied at twice the recommended rate every second year.

Soft fruit and vines – established plantations Soft fruit and vines, established plantations Table 7.6 Nitrogen for soft fruit and vines For bush and cane fruits, nitrogen rates may need to be modified depending on the amount of annual growth required for a particular production system. When nitrogen is deficient, leaves tend to be small and pale green.
For blackcurrants, apply nitrogen in two or three applications, either split across three approximately equal applications timed for late-dormant, May and postharvest or apply 66% at leafing-out and the remainder post-harvest.
The nitrogen recommendations for raspberries are for both floricane and primocane varieties. For floricane varieties, nitrogen should be applied between the onset of floricane growth and the end of July. Avoid applying nitrogen after the end of July to avoid excessive growth of soft cane, unless nitrogen is applied at lower rates through fertigation, where nitrogen applications may continue until the end of August.
For primocane varieties, nitrogen should be applied between emergence and early October. Avoid applying nitrogen after the beginning of October to avoid excessive growth of soft cane.
For crops that are establishing prior to reaching full crop potential, smaller rates of nitrogen are usually adequate. The rate should be adjusted according to the amount of growth required and the results of leaf nitrogen analysis.
Points to consider • Under Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) rules, no fertiliser nitrogen should be applied to field-grown crops during the closed period, a. With continuing change in varieties, adjust nitrogen rates depending on plant vigour.
unless supported by written advice from a FACTS Qualified b. For blackcurrants, varieties developed by James Hutton Ltd in the ‘Ben’ series, typically require Adviser 70–120 kg N/ha. Higher nitrogen rates may reduce fruit quality for processing.
c. Excessive growth of vines will cause wood to ripen slowly and a yield reduction in the following crop. Reduce nitrogen rates where growth is excessive.

Soft fruit and vines – established plantations Substrate strawberry production Table 7.9 Phosphate, potash and magnesium for soil-grown strawberries When strawberries are grown in an inert substrate, a complete nutrient solution is required. Table 7.10 provides guidelines for the normal range of nutrients in solution. Normally, a conductivity of 1.4 mS/cm is maintained during growth and production for main crop ‘June bearers’ and the value should not exceed 2.0 mS/cm.
High salinity can cause marginal necrosis and stimulate leaf and flower tip burn.
During vegetative growth the substrate K:Ca ratio (based on mg/litre K and Ca) should be maintained at 0.65, and at 0.7–0.8 during flowering and fruiting to improve fruit taste and firmness.
To avoid induced magnesium deficiency, the soil K:Mg ratio (based on soil mg/litre K and Mg) should be no greater than 3:1. Plants grown on substrates are very sensitive to excessive concentrations of zinc, boron and sodium in the nutrient solution. Deficiency of iron and Fertigation manganese can occur at high (alkaline) pH levels in the substrate.
Where strawberries or raspberries are grown under a polythene mulch with The nutrients will need to be adjusted depending on whether peat or coir sub-irrigation, nutrients can be applied in the irrigation system (fertigation). On substrates are used. Coir is usually supplied unfertilised and therefore needs soils that encourage vigorous growth, it may be beneficial to reduce nitrogen wetting up for 2–3 days before planting with a feed solution. It needs more rates when applied by fertigation. Where growth is not excessive, the nitrogen calcium, magnesium and sulphur, but less boron and potassium when used rates for the whole season should be the same as those recommended for soil fresh.

Owing to its inherently high pH, coir needs a lower solution pH (5.3–5.8) than At P and K Index 2 or above, maintenance rates of phosphate and potash can for peat (5.6–6.0). Furthermore, feed recipes also depend on the chemical be applied by fertigation. However, where the soil P, K or Mg Index is 0 or 1, composition of the irrigation water and should be modified during the growing the recommended amounts of phosphate and potash should be cultivated into season according to the results of substrate, leaf tissue and drainage solutions the planting bed before the soil is mulched. Irrigation water may also contain analyses.
nutrients, particularly calcium, and care should be taken when mixing with fertiliser as insoluble compounds may form which can block emitters. Careful scheduling of irrigation will help to improve water and nutrient use efficiencies. Recent work has shown savings of 10–20% where irrigation is scheduled to match demand with supply. Monitor substrate moisture content to Points to consider establish which irrigation events can be reduced to save water and fertiliser.

Leaf analysis for top and soft fruit Leaf analysis for top and soft fruit Table 7.11 Leaf analysis – nutrient ranges of major nutrients expressed as elements Leaf analysis is an essential technique for general monitoring of nutrient status and the diagnosis of nutritional disorders. Separate samples should be taken in a similar manner from good and poor areas of growth so that the results can be compared.
In addition, knowledge of leaf nutrient concentrations has proved useful for assessing the nutritional status of crops. Satisfactory ranges for optimal growth and cropping are given in Tables 7.11, 7.12 and 7.13. Where analysis results are to be compared to these standards, it is essential that a representative sample is taken in the correct way and at the correct time.
Because there are seasonal and other factors that influence leaf nutrient concentrations, leaf analysis must be interpreted carefully. Leaf nutrient levels can also vary between varieties. Where there is sufficient information, the standard ranges take account of differences between varieties.
Leaf analysis can be used to provide a more complete indication of the adequacy of the orchard fertiliser programme than can be obtained from soil analysis alone. Where leaf nutrient levels are below the satisfactory range, an increase in fertiliser use can be considered. However, before making a change, the cause of the problem should be further investigated to ensure that other factors such as soil compaction or disease are not involved.
Where the leaf nutrient level is consistently above the satisfactory range for several years, there is justification for a reduction in fertiliser use. In particular, high levels of nitrogen and potash can have adverse effects on apple storage quality and application rates can often be reduced.

Results can also be apples.ahdb.org.uk used to rank orchards for potential storage quality. During the period between sampling for analysis and harvesting the fruit, the concentration of calcium falls Table 7.14 Average nutrient concentrations in Cox, Bramley and Gala apples mainly due to dilution as fruit size increases. Analysing fruit too far in advance (sampled at harvest) of harvest may over-estimate the storage potential.

storage potential Table 7.15 Average nutrient concentrations in Gala and Braeburn apples If fruit analysis produces consistently high or low concentrations of a particular (sampled two weeks prior to harvest) nutrient over two to three years, modification of fertiliser application should be considered. The most likely change will be a reduction in nitrogen or potash use. Fruit analysis may also show deficiencies of calcium or phosphorus which can reduce fruit storage quality. These deficiencies can be corrected by foliar sprays of calcium and phosphorus or by post-harvest calcium treatments.

Potash is important and care must be taken to ensure that the recommended rates are applied annually. To avoid induced magnesium The recommended rates are for maximum yield situations and should be deficiency, the soil K:Mg ratio (based on soil mg/litre K and Mg) should be no applied annually. Nitrogen can reduce the alpha-acid content of hop cones, greater than 3:1.
