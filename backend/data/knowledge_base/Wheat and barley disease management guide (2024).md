Introduction The focus of this guide is on the most The guide provides a concise important diseases of wheat and overview of each disease, with a barley and their reduction through focus on the main risk factors and integrated pest management (IPM). key management steps.
Outlined in the first section are the Disease management programmes key options for IPM, which is a that balance non-chemical and central part of cereal agronomy. chemical options, in the context of At the heart of IPM is a well-designed fungicide resistance, are summarised, rotation (to minimise disease with further details published in the pressure) and an appropriate variety Fungicide programmes for wheat (to resist the main diseases present). and barley factsheet.
Inoculum, weather and region Varieties and crop management Disease pressure Field resistance Figure 1. The extent to which disease develops in a crop is a balance between the likelihood of infection (i.e. disease pressure) and the ability of the crop to resist or avoid infection (i.e. field resistance) Naming of fungal diseases Agreed by international convention, scientific names of pathogenic fungi can change. For example, Septoria tritici was reclassified as Mycosphaerella graminicola, then Zymoseptoria tritici. Sometimes, however, the original scientific names are widely used to describe the diseases they cause. These common names are not italicised (e.g. septoria tritici).

The RL system also compares the yields of varieties grown without fungicides with varieties grown under a robust fungicide programme.
Where the treated yields are much higher than the untreated yield, it indicates that a more intensive spray programme may be required to achieve the variety’s yield potential.
Historically, good disease resistance was associated with a relatively high yield penalty. However, modern cereal varieties have little or no yield penalty compared with varieties with lower resistance. In wheat, the yield of some resistant varieties is just 5% lower when untreated, compared with yields observed when a robust fungicide programme is applied.
Variety selection The relative importance of each resistance rating depends on the local disease profile. The AHDB variety selection tool can help you make better variety choices.
Use it to calculate an ‘agronomic Figure 2. The AHDB Recommended merit’ score for each variety. This Lists (RL) provide information on varietal score takes account of a variety’s resistance to key cereal diseases resistance to key diseases and lodging (instead of looking at AHDB Recommended Lists (RL) trials each component in isolation).

Monitor crops and, if resistance breakdown is suspected, send a leaf Other forms of resistance sample to the UKCPVS. (race-specific/single gene resistance) can provide complete protection ahdb.org.uk/ukcpvs (resistance ratings of 9). However, in these forms, new races of the fungus may develop that result in sudden loss of control from varietal resistance. This is the main type of resistance available against yellow rust. When such a change occurs, the level of varietal susceptibility depends on its underlying race-non-specific resistance.

Cultivation and drilling because they are exposed to infection for longer. For example, For most diseases (Table 1), delayed sowing of winter wheat (from cultivation helps break up and bury mid-September to mid-October) infected crop residues. However, reduces septoria tritici pressure, other factors, such as varietal irrespective of varietal resistance resistance and rotation, can reduce rating. In effect, a moderately disease risk at least as much as – susceptible variety (rating of 5) sown and often more than – ploughing.

diseases, especially when varieties with different disease resistance profiles are grown.
For race-specific pathogens (such as yellow rust), the ways in which varietal mixtures reduce disease are the same as for intercropping (see above). For pathogens that are less specific or unspecific, like rhynchosporium, the mechanisms by which disease is reduced are unclear.
Levels of disease reduction and yield increases depend on many factors, including disease and nutrient levels and crop and varieties chosen.
Although disease reductions of 60% and yield increases of 15% are possible, effects are not usually this large.
Crude mixtures, produced on the farm, work better than homogeneous mixing. More complex mixtures show greater disease reduction; a mixture of three or more varieties is best.

Seedborne diseases The consequence of planting infected Management seed depends on the pathogen in • Inspect seed crops for signs question. Seed can be an important of infection source of some pathogens. However, • Buy certified seed or test for some seedborne diseases, other home-saved seed for the sources of the pathogen (e.g. soil or presence of the pathogen crop debris) are more important.
• Use a fungicidal seed treatment Symptom expression also occurs on infected seed at various growth stages. Some diseases may cause the seedling to die before it emerges. In an emerged crop, some diseases may show symptoms in the seedling.
For some other diseases, however, visible symptoms may not show until a much later growth stage (e.g. after flowering).
Loose smut (wheat, barley and oats) Pathogen Ustilago tritici (wheat), U.nuda (barley) and U. avenae (oats) High-risk factors • Sowing untreated infected seed • Using untested farm-saved seed When infected seed germinates, the fungus grows through the plant and develops in the ear. Symptoms develop after ear emergence.
Varieties with a longer flowering time are more susceptible to infection and windy conditions can increase spread. Cool, moist conditions can prolong flowering and increase the chance that infected crops will spread the disease.

Bunt (wheat) High-risk factors Pathogen • Seedborne infection:
Tilletia tritici - Seed sown without a fungicide treatment, especially over The disease is seedborne and many years soilborne. Symptoms develop after ear emergence. - Slow emergence, caused by suboptimal seedbed conditions • Soilborne infection:
- Very short time between harvesting a first wheat and sowing a second wheat - Dry soil conditions between harvesting and sowing Management • Good machinery and grain storage hygiene • Delay drilling of a second wheat after harvest of an infected crop or wait until after a wet spell • Use a fungicidal seed treatment on infected seed Figure 6.

• Maximise natural enemies of crop pests • Grass strips can provide refuges for cereal aphids. Wildflower strips with a diverse grass mixture are less likely to harbour pests Cereal mosaic viruses Viruses Barley yellow mosaic virus (BaYMV), Barley mild mosaic virus (BaMMV), Oat mosaic virus (OMV), Oat golden stripe virus (OGSV), Soilborne cereal mosaic virus (SBCMV) and Soilborne wheat mosaic virus (SBWMV).
The soilborne parasitic vector Polymyxa graminis infects crop roots and transmits these viruses.
High-risk factors • Previous infection (virus can persist for up to 25 years) • Movement of infected soil, especially by cultivations and machinery movement • Susceptible variety Management • Limit spread through reduced cultivation and good machinery hygiene • Grow resistant barley varieties Figure 35.
