Technical Supplement - Beet Seeds CONDITIONS RELATING TO CROPS FROM WHICH SEED IS TO BE HARVESTED Previous cropping The previous cropping of the field must not be incompatible with the production of seeds of Beta vulgaris L. of the variety of the crop and the field must be sufficiently free from plants which are volunteers from previous cropping.
Varietal identity and varietal purity Crops of beet covered by the regulations are required to have sufficient varietal identity and varietal purity.
Examination of seed and previous multiplications Multiplication seed used to produce seed crops is normally examined in control plots.
It will also have been subject to examination during all stages of its production.
Isolation requirements (Table 1) The crop must conform to the following standards as regards distances from neighbouring sources of pollen:

The distances can be disregarded if there is sufficient protection from any undesirable foreign pollinator. They do not apply in the case of seed crops using the same pollinator.
The ploidy of seed bearing and pollen shedding components of a seed producing crop is established by reference to the Common Catalogue or a National List. If such information is not included on the Common Catalogue or a National List, the ploidy of the components is regarded as unknown for the purposes of isolation distances.

Crop inspection requirements Seed crops must be inspected to determine whether they meet the requirements set out in this Technical Supplement and the seed standards which must be determined mainly by crop inspection.
A crop from which Basic seed is to be produced must be examined by an official crop inspector. At least two inspections must be carried out, one of stecklings and the other of seed producing plants.
CS seed crops in early multiplication must also be inspected by officials. A crop from which CS seed of a listed variety is to be produced may be examined by a licensed inspector, provided the seed sown to produce the crop is subject to satisfactory post control. A minimum of one crop inspection is required.
Crop inspections must be carried out at a time when the cultural condition of the field and stage of development of the crop permit identity and varietal purity to be adequately checked.
Pre-basic crop standards Crops to produce Pre-basic seed must meet the standards for Basic seed CONDITIONS TO BE SATISFIED BY THE SEED CONDITIONS TO BE EXAMINED MAINLY BY FIELD INSPECTION Varietal identity and varietal purity The seed must have sufficient varietal identity and varietal purity. Examination of these seed standards through crop inspection is dealt with in exactly the same way as examination of the crop standards.
CONDITIONS TO BE EXAMINED BY SEED TESTING This specifies those seed qualities which must be examined by seed testing (e.g.
analytical purity, germination, moisture content) and the minimum standards which the seed must meet to be officially certified. Seed tests must be done on a representative sample drawn from the seed lot by an official or by a licensed seed sampler. All seed tests may be done by an Official Seed Testing Station.
Analytical purity The minimum analytical purity of both Basic and CS seed shall be 97% by weight excluding, where appropriate, granulated pesticides, pelleting substances or other solid additives.
Moisture content The prescribed maximum moisture content of seed for both Basic and CS seed is 15% by weight excluding, where appropriate, granulated pesticides, pelleting substances or other solid additives. The test for moisture content must be carried out by an Official Seed Testing Station.
Percentage by weight of other seeds Dec 2016 Page 4 of 136


---
The percentage by weight of other seeds must not exceed 0.3.
Germination (Table 2) A germination test is required to establish whether Basic seed meets the germination standard and CS seed meets the minimum percentage germination set out in column 2 of the table.
In the case of monogerm seed - (a) at least 90% of the germinated clusters shall give single seedlings, and (b) clusters giving three or more seedlings shall not exceed 5% of the germinated clusters.
In the case of precision seed of sugar beet - (a) at least 70% of the germinated clusters shall give single seedlings, and (b) clusters giving three or more seedlings shall not exceed 5% of the germinated clusters.
In the case of precision seed of fodder beet - (a) in the case of a variety with a percentage of diploids exceeding 85%, at least 58% of the germinated clusters shall give single seedlings, and (b) in the case of any other variety, at least 63% of the germinated clusters shall give single seedlings.
In the case of precision seed of fodder beet, clusters giving three or more seedlings shall not exceed 5% of germinated clusters.

Inert matter In the case of monogerm and precision seed, the weight of inert matter shall not exceed– (a) 1.0% in the case of Basic seed, and (b) 0.5% in the case of CS seed.
For the purposes of determining whether the pelleted seed of Basic or CS seed will satisfy these conditions, an official sample of seed drawn from processed seed which has undergone partial decortications (rubbing or grinding) but has not yet been pelleted shall be examined.
OTHER CONDITIONS Diseases which reduce the usefulness of the seed shall be at the lowest possible level that can be achieved.
GENERAL PROVISIONS Pre-basic seed must meet the standards for Basic seed.
LOT AND SAMPLE WEIGHTS (Table 3) Maximum weight of a seed lot, the minimum weight of an official sample and the minimum weight of an official sample for a moisture test:
The maximum weight of a lot may be exceeded by up to 5% These are the minimum sample weights specified in the directive. Where samples are drawn by licensed seed samplers, the minimum weight will normally be twice that shown, because of the need to provide for reserve portions. Moisture samples must be submitted in a sealed, moisture proof container from which as much air as possible has been excluded. Details are given in Instructions to Licensed Seed Samplers.

---
In the case of a hybrid variety or component of a hybrid variety of rye, the crop must conform to the following standards as regards distances from neighbouring sources of pollen which may result in undesirable foreign pollination:
In the case of a crop to produce a hybrid of durum wheat, oats, self pollinating triticale, spelt wheat or wheat, the female component of the crop must be at least 25 metres from a crop of any other variety of the same species, except from a crop of the male component.
The distances do not apply if there is sufficient protection from any undesirable foreign pollination.
Species purity (Table 2) Species purity standards apply only to barley, oats, wheat, durum wheat and spelt wheat, other than hybrids in each case, where the crop is verified at Higher Voluntary Standards (HVS).
Higher Voluntary Standard Crops to produce (percentage by number) Basic Seed 99.99 C1 seed 99.99 C2 seed 99.99 Varietal identity and varietal purity Crops of all species covered by the regulations are required to have sufficient varietal identity and varietal purity.
In the case of an inbred line, a crop is required to have sufficient varietal identity and purity as regards its characteristics.
For the production of seed of a hybrid variety, the requirement for sufficient varietal identity and purity also applies to the characteristics of the components including male sterility or fertility restoration.

These general requirements are supplemented by specific standards for non hybrid and hybrid rye, maize and hybrids of barley, durum wheat, oats, self pollinating triticale, spelt wheat and wheat.
Specific minimum varietal purity standards for non hybrid varieties of barley, durum wheat, oats, self pollinating triticale, spelt wheat and wheat are prescribed as seed standards.
Specific standards for rye, other than a hybrid of rye In the case of rye, other than a hybrid, the number of plants of the crop species which are recognisable as obviously not being true to the variety must not exceed– (a) one per 30 square metres for the production of basic seed; and (b) one per 10 square metres for the production of CS seed.
Specific standards for hybrids of rye In the case of hybrid rye, the crop must have sufficient identity and purity as regards the characteristics of the components, including male sterility.
The number of plants of the crop species which are recognisable as obviously not being true to the component must not exceed – (a) in the case of a crop for the production of basic seed, one per 30 square metres, and (b) in the case of a crop for the production of CS seed, 1 per 10 square metres – in an official field inspection, this standard applies only to the female component.
In the case of basic seed, where male sterility is used, the level of sterility of the male-sterile component must be at least 98%.
Where appropriate, CS seed must be produced in mixed cultivation of a female male-sterile component with a male component which restores male fertility.

loose smut infection of barley, durum wheat, spelt wheat and wheat are prescribed as seed standards to be examined mainly in field inspection.
Crop inspection requirements Seed crops must be inspected to determine whether they meet the requirements set out in this Technical Supplement and the seed standards which must be determined mainly by crop inspection.
A crop from which basic seed is to be produced must be examined by an UK official crop inspector. CS, C1 and C2 seed crops in early multiplication must also be inspected by officials. A crop from which CS, C1 or C2 seed is to be produced may be examined by a licensed inspector, provided the seed sown to produce the crop is subject to satisfactory post control.
Crop inspections must be carried out at a time when the condition and stage of development of the crop permit an adequate examination. Crops to produce HVS seed must not be more than one third lodged at the time of inspection.
A minimum of one crop inspection is required, except for maize where:
(a) at least three inspections must be carried out in the case of an inbred line or hybrid of maize; and (b) where the maize crop to be examined follows a maize crop in either the preceding or current year, at least one special field inspection must be carried out to check that the field is sufficiently free from volunteers from previous cropping.
Pre-basic crop standards Crops to produce Pre-basic seed must meet the standards for Basic seed. HVS does not apply to Pre-basic seed of barley, durum wheat, oats, spelt wheat and wheat. Pre-basic seed of these crops must therefore meet Basic seed minimum standards.
CONDITIONS TO BE SATISFIED BY THE SEED CONDITIONS TO BE EXAMINED MAINLY BY FIELD INSPECTION Varietal identity and varietal purity The seed must have sufficient varietal identity and varietal purity.
The seed of an in-bred line must have sufficient varietal identity and purity as regards its characteristics.
In the case of seed of a hybrid variety, the requirement for sufficient varietal identity and purity also apply to the characteristics of the components.

Varietal purity standards for barley, durum wheat, oats, spelt wheat, wheat and self pollinating triticale, except hybrids in each case (Table 4) The following minimum varietal purity standards apply to barley, durum wheat, oats, spelt wheat and wheat other than hybrids – In the case of self-pollinating triticale, other than a hybrid, the minimum varietal purity standard is – In each case, the minimum varietal purity of seed must be examined mainly in crop inspections.
Varietal purity standards for hybrids of barley, durum wheat, oats, self pollinating triticale, spelt wheat and wheat In the case of a hybrid of durum wheat, oats, self pollinating triticale, spelt wheat and wheat the minimum varietal purity of CS seed of the hybrid variety is 90%.
In the case of a hybrid of barley:
the minimum varietal purity of the CS seed of the hybrid variety is 85% impurities other than the male restorer must not exceed 2%.
This cannot be assessed directly in seed producing crops, therefore it is require that the minimum varietal purity of CS seed be examined mainly in official post control tests on an "appropriate" proportion of samples.

Conditions applying to the production of CS seed of a hybrid maize variety These require that where a female male-sterile component and a male component which does not restore male fertility are used for the production of CS seed of a hybrid variety of maize, the seed shall be produced – (a) by blending seed lots in a proportion appropriate to the variety where, on the one hand a female male-sterile component has been used and, on the other, a female male-fertile component has been used, or (b) by growing the female male-sterile component and the female male-fertile component in a proportion appropriate to the variety.
In the case of seed produced in the manner specified above) the proportion of the female male-sterile and female male-fertile components must be examined in crop inspections.
Loose smut standards for barley, durum wheat, spelt wheat and wheat (Table 5) In the case of barley, wheat, durum wheat and spelt wheat, including hybrids, the maximum percentage by number of loose smut infection is as follows – The incidence of loose smut infection of seed to be examined mainly in crop inspections.
Seed which fails to meet the loose smut standards may be retrieved:
(a) if it has been adequately treated by any product approved by the Secretary of State for the control of loose smut under the Control of Pesticides Regulations (Amendment) 1997; or (b) if an embryo test carried out by an Official Seed Testing Station (OSTS) on a sample submitted for seed testing shows that the seed meets the relevant standard.
CONDITIONS TO BE EXAMINED BY SEED TESTING This specifies those seed qualities which must be examined by seed testing (e.g.
analytical purity, germination, moisture content) and the minimum standards which the seed must meet to be officially certified. Seed tests must be done on a representative sample drawn from the seed lot by an official or by a licensed seed sampler. All seed tests except moisture tests may be done by an Official Seed Testing Station (OSTS) or officially Licensed Seed Testing Station (LSTS). Moisture Dec 2016 Page 16 of 136

Germination (Table 8) A germination test is required to establish whether seed meets the following minimum percentage germination:
The requirement for a germination test does not apply where seed viability is established using a tetrazolium test, unless the result casts doubt about whether the seed will satisfy the germination standard. The tetrazolium test must be carried out at an Official Seed Testing Station or officially Licensed Seed Testing Station, on the official seed sample taken from a seed lot and submitted by the licensed seed sampler. If a full germination test is undertaken in addition to the tetrazolium test, the results take precedence over the tetrazolium test result.

Ergot contamination (Table 9) The number of sclerotia or fragments of sclerotia of Ergot (Claviceps purpurea) in a sample of the weight as specified in the table must not exceed the following – (a) The presence of 5 sclerotia or fragments of sclerotia of ergot in a sample of CS seed of a hybrid variety of rye is deemed to be in conformity with the requirements of regulations where a second sample of the same weight contains not more than 4 sclerotia or fragments of sclerotia.
Moisture content The prescribed maximum moisture content of seed is 17% by weight (all species, categories and levels). The test for moisture content may be done by a licensed seed sampler at the time the official sample is drawn, in which case it is not necessary for an Official Seed Testing Station or officially Licensed Seed Testing Station to undertake a moisture test. If the licensed seed sampler does not do the moisture test, the test must then be done by the Official Seed Testing Station or officially Licensed Seed Testing Station.

CONDITIONS TO BE EXAMINED BY INSPECTION OF CONTROL PLOTS Post control of CS seed of hybrids of barley, durum wheat, oats, self pollinating triticale and wheat In the case of a hybrid of durum wheat, oats, spelt wheat, wheat and selfpollinating triticale, the minimum varietal purity shall be 90% in the case of CS seed.
In the case of a hybrid of barley:
Minimum varietal purity of CS seed shall be at least 85% Impurities other than the male restorer must not exceed 2%.
The minimum varietal purity of seed shall be examined on an appropriate portion of samples.
Post control of Basic seed of hybrids of rye Seed of a hybrid variety of rye cannot be certified as CS seed unless due account has been taken of the results of a post-control test on official samples of the Basic seed of its components. Post control of the Basic seed must be done in the same growing season as the CS seed is produced, to ascertain whether the Basic seed has met the requirements for Basic seed in respect of identity and purity of the characters of the components, including male sterility.
OTHER CONDITIONS Harmful organisms This requires harmful organisms which reduce the usefulness of the seed to be at the lowest possible level. There are no tests prescribed for harmful organisms.
However, persons entering seed for certification must confirm that this condition is met.
GENERAL PROVISIONS Pre-basic seed standards Pre-basic seed must meet the standards for Basic seed. HVS does not apply to Pre-basic seed of barley, durum wheat, oats, spelt wheat and wheat. Pre-basic seed of these species must therefore meet Basic seed minimum standards.

Technical Supplement - Fodder Plant Seeds CONDITIONS RELATING TO CROPS FROM WHICH SEED IS TO BE HARVESTED Previous cropping The previous cropping of the field must not be incompatible with the production of seeds of the species and variety of the crop and the field must be sufficiently free from plants which are volunteers from previous cropping. Please see Annex 1for further guidance.
Isolation requirements (Table 1) In the case of fodder kale, swede and crops of all other species except field peas and apomictic uni-clonal varieties of smooth-stalked meadowgrass (for which there are no specific standards) the crop must conform to the following standards as regards distances from neighbouring sources of pollen which may result in undesirable foreign pollination:
The distances do not apply if there is sufficient protection from any undesirable foreign pollination.

Varietal identity and varietal purity Crops of all species covered by the regulations are required to have sufficient varietal identity and varietal purity. These general requirements are supplemented by specific crop standards for the species. Seed standards for varietal purity examined mainly by field inspection are also prescribed for fodder kale, apomictic uniclonal varieties of smooth-stalked meadowgrass, swede, field beans and field peas.
Specific standards for grasses (except smooth-stalked meadowgrass) Alsike clover, birdsfoot trefoil, fodder radish, lucerne, lupins, red clover, sainfoin, trefoil, black medick, vetches and white clover.
In the case of all grasses (except smooth-stalked meadowgrass) Alsike clover, birdsfoot trefoil, fodder radish, lucerne, lupins, red clover, sainfoin, trefoil, black medick, vetches and white clover, the number of plants of the crop species which are recognisable as obviously not being true to the variety must not exceed – (a) one per 30 square metres for the production of basic seed; and (b) one per 10 square metres for the production of CS seed.
Specific standards for smooth-stalked meadowgrass In the case of smooth-stalked meadowgrass, the number of plants which are recognisable as obviously not being true to the variety must not exceed - (a) for the production of basic seed, one plant per 20 square metres, and (b) for the production of CS seed – (i) except in the case of an apomictic uni-clonal variety, four plants per 10 square metres; and (ii) in the case of an apomictic uni-clonal variety, six plants per 10 square metres.
Species purity Plants of other species, the seeds of which are difficult to distinguish from the crop seeds in a laboratory test, must be at a low level.
The following specific species purity standards apply to festulolium and hybrid, Italian and perennial ryegrass. In the case of these species, the number of plants of a Lolium species or festulolium, other than the crop species itself, must not exceed:
(a) one per 50 square metres for the production of Basic seed; and (b) one per 10 square metres for the production of CS seed.
Number of harvest years (hybrid and Italian ryegrass only) Crops to produce pre-basic, basic, or CS seed of hybrid or Italian ryegrass must not be used to produce a crop in the second harvest year unless – Dec 2016 Page 26 of 136


---
(a) pre-basic seed was produced in the first harvest year in which case basic seed may be produced in the second harvest year, (b) basic seed was produced in the first harvest year from a crop grown from officially certified pre-basic seed, in which case CS seed may be produced in the second harvest year, or (c) for a tetraploid variety of hybrid ryegrass, CS seed was produced in the first harvest year from a crop grown from officially certified basic seed, in which case CS seed may be produced in the second harvest year.
Harmful organisms Harmful organisms which reduce the usefulness of the seed must be at the lowest possible level.
Crop inspection requirements Seed crops must be inspected to determine whether they meet the requirements set out in this Technical Supplement and the seed standards which must be determined mainly by crop inspection.
A crop from which basic seed is to be produced must be examined by an official crop inspector. CS, C1 and C2 seed crops in early multiplication must also be inspected by officials. A crop from which CS, C1 or C2 seed is to be produced may be examined by a licensed inspector, provided the seed sown to produce the crop is subject to satisfactory post control.
A minimum of one crop inspection is required. Crop inspections must be carried out at a time when the condition and stage of development of the crop permit an adequate examination.
Pre-basic crop standards Crops to produce Pre basic seed must meet the standards for Basic seed.
CONDITIONS TO BE SATISFIED BY THE SEED CONDITIONS TO BE EXAMINED MAINLY BY FIELD INSPECTION Varietal identity and varietal purity The seed must have sufficient varietal identity and varietal purity.

Varietal purity standards for fodder kale, apomictic uni-clonal varieties of smooth-stalked meadowgrass, swede, field beans and field peas (Table 2) The following minimum varietal purity standards apply to fodder kale, apomictic uni-clonal varieties of smooth-stalked meadowgrass, swede, field beans and field peas – In each case, the minimum varietal purity of seed must be examined mainly in crop inspections.
CONDITIONS TO BE EXAMINED BY SEED TESTING This specifies those seed qualities which must be examined by seed testing (e.g.
analytical purity, germination) and the minimum standards which the seed must meet to be officially certified. Seed tests must be done on a representative sample drawn from the seed lot by an official or by a licensed seed sampler. All seed tests may be done by an Official Seed Testing Station or officially Licensed Seed Testing Station.

Standards for Melilotus spp. (sweet clover) in seed of small and large seeded legumes The basic seed of small and large seeded legumes is required to be free from seeds of Melilotus spp. (commonly known as sweet clover), in a sample of seed of the weight specified. However, in the case of Alsike clover, birdsfoot trefoil, lucerne, red clover, trefoil, black medick and white clover, one seed of sweet clover in a sample of the specified weight is not regarded as an impurity where a second sample of twice that weight is free from any sweet clover seed.
In the case of CS, C1 and C2 seed of small and large seeded legumes, any sweet clover seed in a sample must not exceed 0.3% by weight.
Standards for Avena fatua, Avena sterilis (includes seeds previously known as Avena ludoviciana) (commonly known as wild oats) The seed of all fodder plant species is required to be free from seeds of wild oats, in a sample of seed of the weight specified in Table 9. However, in the case of basic and CS seed of Alaska brome-grass, rescue grass and tall oatgrass, a maximum of 2 wild oat seeds in a sample of the weight specified in is not regarded as an impurity where a second sample of the same weight is free from any wild oat seeds.
Standards for Cuscuta spp. (commonly known as dodder) The seed of all fodder plant species is required to be free from seeds of dodder in a sample of seed, except – (i) In the case of minimum level CS seed of fine grasses, fodder grasses, fodder kale and swede, the presence of one seed of dodder in a sample is not regarded as an impurity where a second sample of the same weight is free from any dodder seed.
(ii) In the case of minimum level CS seed of Alsike clover, birdsfoot trefoil, trefoil, black medick, lucerne, red clover and white clover, or C1 seed of Lucerne Medicago sativa, the presence of one seed of dodder is not regarded as an impurity where a second sample of the same weight is free from any dodder seed.
Additional standards for lupins It is a requirement that the percentage by number of bitter lupins in a sample of seed of a sweet lupin variety must not exceed – (a) 1% in the case of basic seed; and (b) 2.5% in the case of C1 seed.
It is also a requirement that, in the case of C1 seed, the percentage by number of seeds of another colour in a sample of seed of a bitter lupin variety must not exceed 2%. In the case of C1 seed of lupins, other than bitter lupins, the percentage by number of seeds of another colour in a sample must not exceed 1%.

PROCEDURES FOR CERTIFICATION OF HYBRID SWEDE 1. Introduction Seed of hybrid swede varieties can be certified under The Seed Marketing Regulations. The procedures for certification and early multiplication have the same basis as conventional varieties, with additional requirements for parental lines following those for hybrid oilseed rape.
2. Certification of a seed lot Seed lots are certified in the same way as conventional varieties.
3. Control plots Samples of all multiplication seed lots should be sent to NIAB for control plots. NIAB will acknowledge the receipt of samples of breeders’ seed.
Samples are needed of:
• The male sterile line (female line) FM • Maintainer of the male sterile line MT • Restorer/male pollinator RE Cert 5s should be annotated FM, MT or RE as appropriate to identify samples of parental lines of hybrid varieties.
The closing date for receipt of samples is 15 August.
Crop entries are made in the same way and to the same closing date as conventional varieties. The Cert2 forms should state ‘hybrid swede’ and be annotated FM, MT or RE as appropriate to identify parental lines in the same way as Cert5s.
5. Crop inspection Crops entered to produce pre-basic/basic seed, and all crops of varieties in early multiplication, are inspected by official inspectors. CS crops of listed varieties are inspected by licensed inspectors. Full details are given in the crop inspection procedures.
Isolation distances for field grown crops are the same as for conventional varieties:

Technical Supplement - Oil and Fibre Plant Seed CONDITIONS RELATING TO CROPS FROM WHICH SEED IS TO BE HARVESTED Previous cropping The previous cropping of the field must not be incompatible with the production of seeds of the species and variety of the crop and the field must be sufficiently free from plants which are volunteers from previous cropping.
Please see Annex 1 for further guidance.
Isolation requirements (Table 1) The crop must conform to the following standards as regards distances from neighbouring sources of pollen which may result in undesirable foreign pollination:
Dec 2016 Page 59 of 136



| Crop                                                                                                                                             | Minimum distance      |

| (b) Swede rape (not hybrids) - For the production of basic seed For the production of CS seed                                                    | 200 metres 100 metres |
| (c) Hybrids of swede rape – For the production of basic seed For the production of CS seed                                                       | 500 metres 300 metres |


---
These distances do not apply if there is sufficient protection from any undesirable foreign pollination.
Varietal identity and varietal purity Crops of all species covered by the regulations are required to have sufficient varietal identity and varietal purity.
In the case of an inbred line, a crop is required to have sufficient varietal identity and purity as regards its characteristics.
For the production of seed of a hybrid variety, the requirement for sufficient varietal identity and purity also applies to the characteristics of the components including male sterility or fertility restoration.
These general requirements are supplemented by specific crop standards for black mustard, brown mustard and dioecious hemp, monoecious hemp, hybrids of sunflower and hybrids of swede rape. Specific minimum varietal purity standards for flax, linseed, soya bean, white mustard and non hybrid varieties of sunflower and swede rape are prescribed as seed standards.
Specific standards for black mustard, brown mustard and hemp In the case of black mustard, brown mustard, monoecious hemp and dioecious hemp, the number of plants of the crop species which are recognisable as obviously not being true to the variety must not exceed – (a) one per 30 square metres for the production of basic seed; (b) one per 10 square metres for the production of CS seed (except monoecious hemp); (c) one per 10 square metres for the production of C1 and C2 seed (monoecious hemp only).

Specific standards for hybrids of sunflower In the case of hybrids of sunflower, the percentage by number of plants which are recognisable as obviously not being true to the variety must not exceed – (a) for the production of basic seed – (i) in the case of an inbred line, 0.2%; (ii) in the case of a male parent of a simple hybrid which has shed pollen while 2% or more of the female plants have receptive flowers, 0.2%; and (i) in the case of a female parent, 0.5%; (b) for the production of CS seed – (i) in the case of a male component which has shed pollen while 5% or more of the female plants have receptive flowers, 0.5%; and (ii) in the case of a female component, 1%.
In the case of the production of seed of a hybrid variety of sunflower – (a) sufficient pollen must be shed by the plants of the male component while the plants of the female component are in flower; (b) where the female component plants have receptive stigmas, the percentage by number of female component plants which have shed pollen or are shedding pollen must not exceed 0.5%; (c) for the production of basic seed, the total percentage by number of plants of the female component which are recognisable as obviously not being true to the component and which have shed pollen or are shedding pollen must not exceed 0.5%; and (d) where a female male sterile component and a male component which contains a specific restorer line or lines which restore male fertility has been used for the production of CS seed, at least one third of the plants grown from CS seed of the resulting hybrid must produce pollen which appears normal in all respects.
Specific standards for hybrid varieties of swede rape produced using male sterility In the case of the production of hybrids of swede rape produced using male sterility the percentage by number of plants which are recognisable as obviously not being true to the inbred line or the component must not exceed– (a) for the production of basic seed – (i) in the case of an inbred line, 0.1% (ii) in the case of a male component of a simple hybrid, 0.1%; and (i) in the case of a female component of a simple hybrid, 0.2% Dec 2016 Page 61 of 136


---
(b) for the production of CS seed – (i) in the case of a male component, 0.3% and (ii) in the case of a female component, 1.0% In the case where a male-sterile component is used for the production of seed of a hybrid variety of swede rape male sterility must be at least 99% for the production of basic seed and at least 98% for the production of CS seed. The level of male sterility is assessed by examining flowers for the absence of fertile anthers.
Harmful organisms Harmful organisms which reduce the usefulness of the seed, in particular, in the case of soya bean, Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea, Diaporthe phaseolorum var. caulivora and var. sojae, Phialophora gregata and Phytophthora megasperma f.s.p glycinea must be at the lowest possible level.
Crop inspection requirements Seed crops must be inspected to determine whether they meet the requirements set out in this Technical Supplement and the seed standards which must be determined mainly by crop inspection.
A crop from which basic seed is to be produced must be examined by an official crop inspector. CS, C1, C2 and C3 seed crops in early multiplication must also be inspected by officials. A crop from which CS, C1, C2 or C3 seed is to be produced may be examined by a licensed inspector, provided the seed sown to produce the crop is subject to satisfactory post control.
Crop inspections must be carried out at a time when the condition and stage of development of the crop permit an adequate examination.
A minimum of one crop inspection is required, except:
(a) at least two inspections must be carried out in the case of a hybrid of sunflower; and (b) at least three inspections must be carried out in the case of a hybrid of swede rape as follows - (i) the first inspection must be carried out before the flowering stage; (ii) the second inspection must be carried out at the early flowering stage; and (i) the third inspection must be carried out at the end of the flowering stage.
Pre-basic crop standards Crops to produce Pre-basic seed must meet the standards for Basic seed.

CONDITIONS TO BE SATISFIED BY THE SEED CONDITIONS TO BE EXAMINED MAINLY BY FIELD INSPECTION Varietal identity and varietal purity The seed must have sufficient varietal identity and varietal purity.
In the case of seed of a hybrid variety of swede rape, the requirement for sufficient varietal identity and purity also apply to the characteristics of the components, including restoration of male sterility or fertility.
Varietal purity standards for flax, linseed, soya bean, sunflower, swede rape, turnip rape and white mustard and components and hybrid varieties of swede rape produced using male sterility (Table 2) The following minimum varietal purity standards apply:

In each case, the minimum varietal purity of seed must be examined mainly in crop inspections carried out in accordance with the conditions.
See also the minimum varietal purity of CS seed of swede rape.
Conditions applying to the production of CS seed of a hybrid sunflower variety These require that where a female male-sterile component and a male component which does not restore male fertility are used for the production of CS seed of a hybrid variety of sunflower, the seed shall be produced by blending the seed produced by the female male-sterile component with seed produced by the male component. The ratio of seed produced by the female male-sterile component to seed produced by the male fertile component must not exceed two to one.
CONDITIONS TO BE EXAMINED BY SEED TESTING This specifies those seed qualities which must be examined by seed testing (e.g. analytical purity, germination, harmful organisms) and the minimum standards which the seed must meet to be officially certified. Seed tests must be done on a representative sample drawn from the seed lot by an official or by a licensed seed sampler. All seed tests for analytical purity, content of seeds of other plant species, germination and the harmful organism Sclerotinia sclerotiorum may be done by an Official Seed Testing Station or officially Licensed Seed Testing Station. Seed tests for other harmful organisms must currently be carried out only by an Official Seed Testing Station (because there are no LSTSs qualified in the tests).
Components of hybrid varieties of swede rape This paragraph permits biochemical assessment of the varietal purity of Basic seed of a component of a hybrid variety of swede rape, where official post control of the Basic seed has not been carried out in accordance with the requirements.

CONDITIONS TO BE EXAMINED BY INSPECTION OF CONTROL PLOTS Post control of Basic seed of hybrids of swede rape This is about official post control tests on samples of basic seed being multiplied for the production of CS seed. The seed cannot be certified as CS seed unless due account has been taken of the results of the post control tests on the Basic seed.
The post control tests must be carried out during the growing season of the crop entered for the production of CS seed, to determine whether the basic seed has met the requirements for basic seed prescribed in respect of identity and purity as regards the characteristics of the components, including male sterility. (But see also notes, concerning the option of biochemical assessment of the basic seed).
OTHER CONDITIONS Harmful organisms This requires harmful organisms which reduce the usefulness of the seed to be at the lowest possible level that can be achieved.
GENERAL PROVISIONS Pre-basic and Commercial seed standards This paragraph prescribes that:
(a) Pre-basic seed must meet the standards for Basic seed; and (b) Commercial seed of black mustard must meet the conditions for CS seed in the regulations insofar as these are relevant to Commercial seed.

The distances in Table 1 do not apply if there is sufficient protection from any undesirable foreign pollination.
Diseases and harmful organisms Diseases and harmful organisms which reduce the usefulness of the seed must be at the lowest possible level.
Crop inspection requirements Seed crops must be inspected to determine whether they meet the requirements set out in this Technical Supplement and the seed standards which must be determined mainly by crop inspection.
All seed crops must be examined by an official crop inspector.
Crop inspections must be carried out at a time when the cultural condition of the field and stage of development of the crop permit the varietal identity, varietal purity and health status of the crop to be adequately checked.
A minimum of one crop inspection is required.
Pre-basic crop standards Crops to produce Pre-basic seed must meet the standards for Basic seed CONDITIONS TO BE SATISFIED BY THE SEED CONDITIONS TO BE EXAMINED MAINLY BY FIELD INSPECTION Varietal identity and varietal purity The seed must have sufficient varietal identity and varietal purity.
In the case of turnips the minimum varietal purity is specified as – (a) 99.7% in the case of basic seed, and (b) 98.0% in the case of CS seed.
Examination of these seed standards through crop inspection is dealt with in exactly the same way as examination of the crop standards.
CONDITIONS TO BE EXAMINED BY SEED TESTING This Part specifies those seed qualities which must be examined by seed testing (e.g. analytical purity, germination) and the minimum standards which the seed must meet to be officially certified. Seed tests must be done on a representative sample drawn from the seed lot by an official seed sampler. All seed tests must be done by an Official Seed Testing Station or officially Licensed Seed Testing Station.

Annex 2 – Early Multiplication of seed 1. Early multiplication allows for seed to progress through the multiplication categories before the variety is added to a National List or the Common Catalogue. This enable s seed stocks to be built up in advance of a variety being listed.
• The variety must be entered for National Listing in the UK or another EU Member State.
• If the variety fails or is withdrawn from National List testing, it ceases to be eligible for early multiplication.
• No marketing can take place until the variety is listed.
2. The application procedure mirrors the official seed certification requirements for a variety already on a National List or the EU Common Catalogue:
• Entry of the seed lot for multiplication and control plot (CERT 5) • Entry of a seed crop and application for official inspection (CERT 2) • Crop inspection and report (CERT 3) • Sampling and Testing (CERT 5) • Seed testing and report (CERT 10) • Notification of early multiplication (CERT 7/7Summ) 3. Marketing cannot take place until the variety is added to a National List or the Common Catalgue.
SEED LOT ENTRIES 4. A sample from the seed lot is submitted to NIAB accompanied by a CERT 5. This is to ensure that official samples of all seed lots, which are intended to be multiplied, are sent to NIAB for sowing in control plots.
CROP ENTRIES 5. Crops are entered for seed production using form CERT 2 (notification) and CERT 2A (payment). All crops entered for early multiplication are subject to official inspection.
CROP INSPECTION CERT 3 6. NIAB will arrange for official inspection of crops of varieties in early multiplication to produce CS, C1, C2 and C3 (where applicable). Earlier generation pre-basic and basic are always officially inspected.

CROP INSPECTION REPORTS CERT 3 7. Crop inspection reports are a lodged with NIAB on completion of the official inspection. Reports are copied to the applicant.
SEED SAMPLING AND SEED TESTING 8. Once seed is processed, divided into seed lots, sealed and labelled it must be sampled and tested to establish whether it meets the prescribed seed standards.
An application for sampling and testing of a seed lot (CERT 5) must be completed.
9. The seed lot status is not confirmed until a seed test report CERT 10 has been issued detailing the test results.
COMPLETION OF SEED STAGE (CERT 7/7SUMM) 10. The seed stage is completed, when a CERT 7 or CERT 7Summ form is completed and submitted with the seed lot fee. This maintains pedigree records and allows the next stage of multiplication to continue. The seed test report should be lodged as soon as possible. Once the variety is added to the UK National List or EU Common Catalogue, the seed test report becomes automatically lodged and certification is completed in retrospect.
LABELLING OF EARLY MULTIPLIED SEED 11. All labels for seed of varieties under early multiplication should be over-printed ‘Seed Not Certified’ by the applicant/processor. An official label appropriate to the category and level must be used.

Annex 3 – Guide to Statutory Tetrazolium testing for certification in England and Wales 1. BACKGROUND The Seed Marketing Regulations 2011 (Schedule 4, Part 2, Regulation 6) allow the use of a statutory tetrazolium (STZ) test on all categories of certified cereals as an alternative to the full germination test. The STZ results will be reported on a CERT 10 as STZ% and the number of seeds examined must be stated under remarks. Both OSTSs and LSTSs can carry out the tetrazolium test for certification of cereal seed.
The tetrazolium test is a viability test where living tissue is stained red. The staining patterns are interpreted to categorise seeds into viable and non-viable. The STZ test correlates well with germination but under some situations will give an over-estimate. For example, the STZ test does not detect dormancy or any damage to germination that will occur due to the presence of seed-borne diseases, or from the adverse effects of chemicals, e.g. glyphosate damage.
If there is any doubt about whether a STZ test should be carried out (e.g. because of seed treatment, disease or where heat damage is present at 5% or more) then a germination test should be done.
The results of an official germination test will always take precedence over the STZ result.
When a derogation is in place a 400 STZ test must be carried out. Contact the OSTS for advice.
If seed lots are being certified using a STZ test they cannot be early moved. The applicant must wait for the STZ, purity and other seed count results, plus confirmation that the seed lot passes certification at the appropriate category and level before moving the seed lot.
All reserve portions that have been tested using STZ will be checked tested by STZ. Enforcement testing will always use a germination test.
2. SPECIES COVERED BY STZ A STZ test can be carried out on all cereal species covered by the Regulations. Training and assessment will normally be on barley and wheat. Oats can be included on request. The assessment criteria for Triticale is the same as for wheat but the standards and therefore the tolerances are different. Candidates should discuss their requirements with the OSTS.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It will be the responsibility of the Applicant /seed analysts to ensure seed is suitable for testing by STZ. Certification will be withdrawn if seed tested by STZ is subsequently found not to meet the prescribed germination standard. Please also note that seed must continue to meet the prescribed standard at the point of marketing. It is an offence to market seed which does not meet prescribed standards, even though those standards were met at the point of certification.

Annex 4 – Late entered seed lots and crops without control plots of the sown seed SEED LOT ENTRY The Seed Marketing Regulations make provision that seed lots may be accepted into the certification scheme after the closing date. These seed lots are known as late entered seed lots.
Seed lots accepted for multiplication under this provision, without an official sample for a control plot, will require an official inspection. The only exception being for seed lots entered to produce CS seed of hybrid rye and hybrid oilseed rape, for which there must always be a control plot.
Late Entered Seed Lot NIAB, as soon as they are aware of a late entered sample, will inform the applicant stating:
• The sample was received after the closing date.
• The sample was received too late for drilling in control plots.
• An official inspection will be required.
NIAB will confirm whether or not a late entered seed lot will be accepted and that all crops entered for seed certification will require an official inspection.
CROP ENTRIES An applicant who has sown or intends to sow a crop where a sample of the sown seed lot has not been submitted, or was submitted too late for sowing in control plots, should notify NIAB that they want the seed lot to be accepted as late entered. For late entered seed lots encountered at crop entry NIAB will inform the crop applicant and, if appropriate, the company that certified the seed from that crop can only be accepted if the seed lot is accepted as late entered.
For all rye crops entered for further multiplication where no standard sample exists, the crops are subject to an official inspection.
For hybrid crops where no standard sample exists the crop/s are subject to an official inspection.
Field Inspection of Crops - Late Entered Seed Lot Accepted If a late entered seed lot is sown to produce seed, the regulations require that an official inspector inspect the crops. NIAB will arrange for official inspectors to carry out an official Dec 2016 Page 90 of 136

inspection. This will apply to crops sown to produce CS, C1, C2 or C3 which would normally be inspected by licensed crop inspectors. Official inspections will be subject to the appropriate official inspection fee.
Confirmation of varietal identity without a control plot For some species (e.g. grasses), varieties and circumstances (e.g. crops of varieties in early multiplication and sown with breeder’s seed), a control plot is needed to confirm varietal identity.
Crops without control plots fall into two distinct types: - (i) Varieties familiar to NIAB specialists Any such entered seed lot without a standard should only be accepted under the following conditions.
• A standard sample from the Certifying Authority who carried out the DUS testing is needed, to assist in the establishment of varietal identity.
• A test to establish varietal identity is carried out and confirms that the varietal characteristics of the variety under test match those of the standard.
• Where no sample exists, the official crop inspector is satisfied that the variety in the field matches the description/their knowledge.
For PB and B crops NIAB will organise an official inspection.
For Certified generations An official inspection will be organised of representative crops.
(ii) Varieties that are not familiar to NIAB A check for varietal identity, using laboratory examination, electrophoresis or DNA testing could be carried out. Providing the sample representing the seed lot matches that of the standard, then the seed lot can be accepted and an official inspection carried out.
• The applicant should formally accept responsibility for the risk and consequences arising from the limitations of establishing varietal identity without a control plot.
• An adequate description from the Testing Authority must be obtained to assist the crop inspector.
The crop inspector/s may be given a form of words to qualify the crop approval statement on the CERT 3, taking into account the limitations of inspecting an unfamiliar crop without the back up of control plots.
Testing For most species it is possible to carry out a check for varietal identity, using laboratory examination, electrophoresis or DNA testing. Such a test must be sufficiently robust for the species. It should be recognised however that the laboratory examination, electrophoresis or DNA test may not be as reliable as a control plot for varietal identity and may not detect varietal purity problems.
Dec 2016 Page 91 of 136


---
If a varietal purity problem is identified during testing, then the decision to withdraw certification or leave it to the field inspection would be made.
Varietal Identity There are situations where a control plot is necessary to confirm varietal identity, for example grasses and crops of varieties in early multiplication and sown with breeder’s seed. NIAB will advise Animal and Plant Health Agency that the seed lot should not be accepted as late entered.
Restriction A requirement of this provision is that an official inspection should be carried out. Limited resources may restrict the number of entries that can be accepted under this provision.
Late Entry Rejected If a late entered seed lot is not accepted, then future crop inspection is not relevant as crops have to be produced from either an entered or a late entered seed lot.
Fee A separate fee may be applied to late entered seed lots to cover:
• Extra work involved in handling the information.
• Any laboratory exam, electrophoresis or DNA testing.

Annex 5 – Seed imports from other member states and third countries Part I: Seed Imported from other Member States Legislation The Seed Marketing Regulations and the relevant EU Directives.
Breeder’s seed 1. Breeder’s seed intended for multiplication to Pre-basic or Basic seed may be imported from another Member state. The procedures are the same as for Breeder’s seed produced in the UK. The seed should be sampled after import, by a licensed seed sampler, for sowing in an official control plot.
Officially certified seed – variety listing requirements 2. Seed must be of a variety which is listed (i.e. on the UK National List or EU Common Catalogue) before it is officially certified, except for:
(a) Pre-basic or Basic seed of an unlisted component of a hybrid variety may be officially certified, provided the hybrid variety to be produced from the component is listed; (b) Seed of a variety or component of a hybrid variety whose entry on a National List and EU Common Catalogue has expired, but for which a marketing extension granted by any Member State is in force, may be officially certified.

Mixtures 4. Mixtures permitted by the the EU Seed Marketing Directives prepared, packed, sealed and labelled in another Member state, may be imported for marketing.
Standard Seed of vegetables 5. Standard Seed of vegetables packed, sealed and labelled in accordance with the Vegetable Seed Directive and imported from other Member States may be marketed. The seed must be of a variety which is on a National List or the EU Common Catalogue, unless it is marketed under an authorisation (see the authorisations section in this guide).
Verification at HVS 6. Seed of cereal and fodder species officially certified by another Member State may be verified as meeting HVS, provided the HVS standard applies to the species. A sample from the seed lot must be submitted to NIAB for verification. NIAB will issue a certificate stating the results. If seed is verified as meeting HVS, it should be re-labelled, using Animal and Plant Health Agency official labels, overprinted with the HVS symbol or HVS letters. The original country of production must be stated.
Re-grading 7. Seed officially certified by another Member state may be re-graded in the UK, provided it meets the requirements for the new category. Seed which is re-graded should be re-labelled using official Animal and Plant Health Agency labels. The original country of production should be printed on the Animal and Plant Health Agency label. Applications to re-grade seed officially certified by another Member State should be made to NIAB.
Imported seed for early multiplication of varieties, which are not yet listed 8. Seed, which has met all the requirements for official certification by another Member state, except the listing requirement, may be imported from another Member state pending listing. The seed may be entered for early multiplication before listing, but it cannot be marketed until it is listed. The procedures for entering unlisted seed for early multiplication are the same as those for a listed variety. The seed should be labelled with an official label appropriate to the category and level and be overstamped ‘Seed Not Certified’.
Imports of Seed Not Finally Certified (grey label seed) 9. Seed of any category harvested in another Member State may be imported for final certification provided it is seed of a species eligible to be certified at that category in England and Wales.
10. The seed must have been crop inspected and achieved the standards for the category for which it had been entered.

Documents which must accompany the seed 11. The seed must be accompanied by an official document containing the information detailed in the Directives. This must be lodged with NIAB. This should be done before the seed is submitted for testing.
Packaging, sealing and labelling requirements 12. The seed must be packed and sealed in accordance with Directive requirements.
It must be labelled with a grey label containing the information shown in the Regulations Final certification as UK officially certified seed 13. The seed should be sampled, sealed, labelled and tested in the same way as UK produced seed. It must meet the same seed conditions for the category for which is has been entered. Provided it meets all requirements, it is certified as UK officially certified seed. The certified seed must be labelled with Animal and Plant Health Agency official labels. The original country of production must be printed on the label.
This seed may be officially certified for early movement in the same way as seed harvested from crops produced in the UK.
Verification at HVS and Re-grading Seed imported as ‘not finally certified’ may be entered for HVS or re-graded.
Part II - Seed Imported From Third Countries Please consult the OECD Seed Schemes - Varietal Certification and Control of Seed Moving in International Trade.
Genetically modified seed Packing, sealing and labelling requirements should follow procedures for genetically modified seed (if applicable).
Breeder’s seed (Not Certified) 1. Breeder’s seed intended for multiplication to Pre-basic or Basic seed may be imported from any equivalent Third Country. The packing, sealing and labelling requirements, including chemically treated seed, are exactly the same as for Breeder’s seed produced in England and Wales. The seed should be sampled after import, by a licensed seed sampler for sowing in an official control plot.

Wales.
24. Not Finally Certified seed of a variety which is the subject of a marketing extension in the EU may also be imported for final certification in England and Wales, provided the variety is on the OECD list of varieties eligible for certification.
Conditions which must be met:
25. Seed harvested in a third country may be certified if— • it has been produced directly from— basic seed or certified seed of the first generation certified either in a member State or in a third country that has been granted equivalence under Council Decision 2003/17/EC on the equivalence of field inspections carried out in third countries on seed-producing crops and on the equivalence of seed produced in third countries; or • the crossing of basic seed officially certified in a member State with basic seed certified in such a third country; • it has undergone field inspection in accordance with Council Decision 2003/17/EC; • examination has shown that the conditions for seed of that category are satisfied; • it is accompanied by a certificate from the competent authority of the country of origin certifying its status.
The label must be grey.
The document confirming crop inspection standards must be lodged with NIAB. This should be done before the seed is tested for certification.
Final certification as UK officially certified seed 26. The seed should be sampled, sealed, labelled and tested in the same way as UK produced seed. It must meet the same seed conditions as seed harvested in England and Wales. Provided it meets all the requirements, it is certified as UK officially certified seed.
The certified seed must be labelled with Animal and Plant Health Agency OECD official labels, amended to show the original country of production. This seed may be officially certified for early movement in the same way as seed harvested from crops produced in the UK.
Verification at HVS 27. Seed imported as Not Finally Certified seed may be verified at HVS. Applications to verify seed imported not finally certified at HVS should be made to NIAB.
Re-grading 28. Seed imported as Not Finally Certified seed may also be re-graded after certification.
Decisions to re-grade may be taken in the same way as decisions to re-grade UK officially certified seed harvested from crops produced in the UK.

Mixtures 29. Mixtures of Herbage seed (Amenity and Agricultural) are permitted under the OECD Seed Schemes.
In all other circumstances seed officially certified in an equivalent Third Country may be mixed after import in accordance with the Seed Marketing Regulations.
These mixtures should be labelled with Animal and Plant Health Agency OECD official labels. All the original country(s) of production of the individual components must be shown on the label.
Vegetable Seed 30. Standard seed of vegetables can be imported from any Third Country. However, the equivalence decision does not provide for any Third Country imports of certified vegetable seed.
Requirement to provide information on imported seed from Third Countries 31. Anyone marketing more than 2Kg of seed imported from Third Countries must provide specific information to Animal and Plant Health Agency. This only applies to the first marketing in the Community. For example, where seed is imported into France from a Third Country, and first marketing takes place there, notification should be to the French authorities. If the seed is subsequently imported into England and Wales, it is not necessary to notify Animal and Plant Health Agency.

Annex 6 – Guide to applying for authorisation to market seed for:
• Tests and Trials • The purpose of gaining knowledge from practical experience during cultivation for vegetable varieties • Scientific Purposes and Selection Work 1. Introduction There are exceptions to the Seed Marketing Regulations for England, which if certain conditions are met, allow an authorisation to be granted to market: - (a) Appropriate quantities of uncertified seed of unlisted agricultural varieties for tests or trials; (b) Uncertified seed of unlisted vegetable varieties for the purpose of gaining knowledge from practical experience during cultivation; (c) Small quantities of uncertified seed of unlisted or listed agricultural or vegetable varieties, for scientific purposes or selection work.
1.2 Applicants wishing to use these arrangements must have prior authorisation from Animal and Plant Health Agency before marketing any seed.
1.3 Different arrangements may apply in Scotland and Northern Ireland and producers should consult the relevant Certifying Authority.
1.4 Animal and Plant Health Agency will handle applications on behalf of the National Assembly for Wales and these will be dealt with under the Welsh Seed Marketing Regulations 2004 and 2005. Animal and Plant Health Agency will maintain a central register of all authorisations issued in the UK.
1.5 Authorisations can permit Community wide marketing.
1.6 There are reciprocal arrangements between Member States (MSs) for reporting authorisations issued, withdrawn or rejected.
1.7 Applications for authorisation in England and Wales should be made to the Animal and Plant Health Agency Cambridge office.

2. MARKETING UNLISTED AGRICULTURAL VARIETIES FOR TESTS AND TRIALS Granting of authorisations 2.1 Applicants must be producers established in England or Wales or their representatives.
2.2 There must be a current National List application for the variety in the UK and this application must not have been withdrawn or a final decision made.
2.3 For seed of a genetically modified (GM) variety, the applicant must have consent under Council Regulation (EC) No. 1829/2003 on genetically modified food and feed or under Part C of Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms.
Quantities 2.4 For agricultural varieties the maximum quantities of seed per variety that may be authorised are:
If these quantities are not enough to sow 10 hectares in that MS then the specific amount needed may be authorised.
Trial Location 2.5 The location of the trial sites may be in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales or another EU Member State. Animal and Plant Health Agency will contact the relevant Devolved Administration or Member State for clearance before granting an authorisation.
Time Period 2.6 Authorisations will be granted for a period of not more than one year and can be renewed on application.

Cessation 2.7 An authorisation will become invalid once the variety is added to the National List or the National List application is withdrawn or rejected. An authorisation may be withdrawn for breach of conditions.
2.8 If a prohibition on the use of the variety is published in the Gazette then it will not be possible to continue marketing the seed.
How to apply for an authorisation and notification 2.9 Applications should be made in writing to Animal and Plant Health Agency providing the information outlined in the application letter which includes variety names or reference numbers, trial location, the nature of the intended trials and amounts of seed. These details are necessary for the application to proceed. Applicants will normally be notified within 14 days whether or not authorisation has been granted.
This should be taken into account when deciding whether to apply for authorisation, as seed cannot be marketed until authorisation has been granted. NIAB will be informed of all successful applications.
Please note the following requirements: - • The seed may only be used for the purposes of tests or trials carried out at agricultural enterprises to gather information on the cultivation or use of the varieties to which the application relates; • The seed must have met the crop and seed standards and, if requested, copies of the relevant reports should be provided to Animal and Plant Health Agency within the time period specified; • The seed is correctly labelled; • To keep records of the results of the tests and trials, the amount of seed marketed and the name of the MS for which the seed was intended. These records should be made available on request to authorised officers of Animal and Plant Health Agency.
Technical Conditions 2.10 Test and trial seed of unlisted agricultural species must meet the crop and seed standards for the final generation of the species and crop type concerned, as set out in the Regulations.
Crop standards 2.11 For crop standards, it will be the applicant’s responsibility to ensure that a satisfactory crop inspection report can be provided. The simplest way to do this is to produce the seed from a crop approved under the arrangements for early multiplication. This avoids the entry of a crop specifically to produce test and trial seed and gives much more flexibility.

Seed Standards 2.12 Seed must be sampled and tested and a Cert 10 test report produced. Test and trial seed can be re-entered from an early multiplication seed lot submitting a Cert7/7summ and fee in the usual way.
2.13 Test and trial seed must be packed, sealed and labelled with an orange official label in accordance with the Regulations.
3. MARKET TESTING OF UNLISTED VEGETABLE VARIETIES 3.1 The procedure to be followed is similar to that for the test and trial of agricultural species with the following exceptions:- Application 3.2 A description of the variety and details of maintenance should be provided.
3.3 The authorisation will include a requirement that the seed may only be used for the purposes of gaining knowledge from practical experience during cultivation.
3.4 An authorisation will not be granted unless a National List application has been made for the variety in the UK or in another MS, which has not been withdrawn or a final decision made.
3.5 For seed of a genetically modified (GM) variety, the applicant must have consent under Council Regulation (EC) No. 1829/2003 on genetically modified food and feed or under Part C of Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms Technical Conditions 3.6 There is no requirement to make a formal certification application.
3.7 For the market testing of unlisted vegetable species, seed must meet the standards required by the Seed Regulations.

Cessation 3.8 An authorisation will become invalid once the variety is added to the National List or the National List application is withdrawn or rejected. An authorisation may be withdrawn for breach of conditions.
3.9 If a prohibition on the use of the variety is published in the Gazette then it will not be possible to continue marketing the seed.
Time Period 3.10 Authorisations will be granted for a period of one year and are renewable twice for a period not exceeding one year each.
Quantities 3.11 There are no quantitative restrictions on the amount of seed that may be marketed under an authorisation.
Labelling 3.12 Packages must have an orange supplier’s label and include the statement: ‘Variety not yet officially listed’.
3.13 In other respects the labelling requirements are the same as for agricultural seed except that the name of the Certifying Authority and MS or their distinguishing abbreviation is not relevant for vegetable seed and need not be included on the label.
Samples and Records 3.14 A sample from each lot marketed to be retained for not less than two years.
3.15 Records of seed lots of the seed marketed should be kept for not less than 3 years.
These records should be made available on request to authorised officers of Animal and Plant Health Agency.
3.16 Authorised officers may also ask for information gained from practical experience during cultivation of the variety, the quantity of seed marketed during the authorised period and which MS the seed was destined for.
4. MARKETING VARIETIES FOR SCIENTIFIC PURPOSES AND SELECTION WORK 4.1 The procedure to be followed is similar to that for the test and trial of agricultural species with the following exceptions:- Dec 2016 Page 106 of 136


---
Application 4.2 An application to Animal and Plant Health Agency may be made whether or not the variety is listed in the National List.
Quantities 4.3 The Regulations do not define what is meant by a "small quantity" of seed for scientific purposes or selection work. This will be considered on a case-by-case basis and applicants should state the amount of seed they propose to market. As a guideline we would not expect to authorise marketing of more than the amount of seed required for DUS testing (e.g. 1 kg for winter oilseed rape, 3 kg for wheat, 3 kg for peas etc).
4.4 Authorisation is required for each individual marketing of seed but an application may cover more than one request for marketing. For example, a producer wishing to market two separate 1 kg "parcels" of wheat seed to different persons may request authority in one application.
Notification 4.5 The authorisation will include a requirement that the seed be used only for scientific purposes or selection work.
Cessation 4.6 The authorisation will not be limited in duration.
Labelling 4.7 Packages must have an orange supplier’s label and include the statement: ‘Not yet officially listed’ (unlisted varieties only).
4.8 All other labelling details are as specified in the Seed Marketing Regulations.

Annex 7 – Guide to applying for an authorisation to market preservation mixtures consisting of crop-grown or directly harvested uncertified fodder plant seed INTRODUCTION The requirements for marketing Fodder seed preservation mixtures in England have been revised following the introduction of new European legislation (Commission Directive 2010/60/EU) and corresponding English regulations. This guide explains the procedure for applying for an authorisation.
1. DEFINITIONS a. Preservation Mixture Means a mixture containing seed of prescribed (regulated) species of Fodder Plants covered by Schedule 1 of the Seed Marketing Regulations and is exempt from some of the usual requirements, in particular for variety registration and seed certification. The mixture may also contain seed of plants that are not covered by the legislation. Mixtures consisting entirely of non-prescribed species do not require authorisation.
Preservation mixtures are of species and ecotypes compatible with specific natural and seminatural habitats and intended for use in preservation of the natural environment and the conservation of plant genetic resources.
Note: ‘Green hay’ harvested from a donor site and spread directly on a recipient site without processing is not considered to be seed and is therefore not covered by this legislation.
b. Region of origin This will be the UK unless Animal and Plant Health Agency or the Devolved Administrations have a specific reason to draw it more tightly. Seed of preservation mixtures may only be marketed in the region of origin.
c. Source area Means an area within the region of origin designated as a special area for conservation or recognised as a UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) priority habitat. The location of the BAP Priority Habitat can be defined at the National Character Area (NCA) level, County/Local Authority level, by Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), or Site of Special Scientific Interest (SI) the seed is collected from.
d. Collection Site Means a site within the source area from which the seed is collected. It must not have been sown with agricultural or amenity varieties in the 40 years prior to the date of the application by Dec 2016 Page 108 of 136

the producer.
e. Crop-Grown seed Means seed of individual species taken from a collection site and multiplied outside the site as single species. It may then be used to create a mixture typical for the habitat type of the collection site.
f. Directly harvested seed Means a seed mixture marketed as harvested from the collection site with or without further cleaning.
g. Legislation:
Commission Directive 2010/60/EU Fodder Plant Seed Marketing Directive 66/401/EEC The Seed Marketing Regulations 2011 2. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR APPLICATIONS FOR AN AUTHORISATION a. Applicants wanting to market preservation mixtures of crop-grown or directly harvested uncertified fodder plant seed must be licensed for the purpose of seed marketing operations under the Seed Marketing Regulations.
b. Preservation mixtures may not be marketed until an authorisation has been approved and confirmed in writing (see Section 3 for details of how to apply).
Authorisation conditions include the reporting requirements in paragraph 8 below.
c. Once the applicant has been licensed for seed marketing operations and an authorisation for preservation mixtures has been confirmed, the mixture may be marketed freely within the region of origin, subject to the conditions set out in the authorisation. The prescribed species in the mixtures must be those stated in the authorisation.
d. The authorisation will last for one year after which it can be renewed.
e. For crop-grown seed, multiplication after collection from the original site may take place for five generations.
f. For prescribed species in crop-grown mixtures, each batch of seed must be tested at an Official or Licensed Seed Testing Station to determine germination and ensure that certified seed standards for analytical purity and other seeds are met. Certified seed standards can be found in Annex II of the Fodder Plant Seed Marketing Directive 66/401/EEC. Ideally, seed should be sampled by a Licensed Seed Sampler (contact Seed Marketing Team at Animal and Plant Health Agency for information on Seed Sampler courses).
g. Visual inspection of the collection site of a directly harvested mixture may be necessary to assess some requirements in the legislation. Any inspections will be overseen by Natural England.

15. Any chemical treatment if applicable 6. COMPANY RECORDS Information relating to marketing seed of preservation mixtures, including a list of all components and their source, must be retained for at least three years and made available for inspection by an official from Animal and Plant Health Agency.
7. SEED SAMPLES A sample representing each seed lot must be kept for one year and made available to an official from Animal and Plant Health Agency.
8. REPORTING INFORMATION TO ANIMAL AND PLANT HEALTH AGENCY At the beginning of each season, producers must provide Animal and Plant Health Agency (Seed Marketing Cambridge) with information on the size and location of their intended collection and seed multiplication sites together with an estimate of quantities for marketing in the coming year. Producers are required to provide details, no later than 30 June, of the amount of seed of preservation mixtures marketed in the previous season.
This can be done at the same time as renewing authorisations.

Annex 8 – Guidelines for marketing seed of agricultural conservation varieties in England and Wales These guidelines are for the marketing of seed of agricultural conservation varieties in accordance with The Seed Marketing Regulations and corresponding legislation in Wales.
A Conservation Variety is defined as a landrace or plant variety that is naturally adapted to local and regional conditions and is threatened by genetic erosion.
1. Conditions for seed marketing 1.1 Companies and individuals producing or marketing seed of conservation varieties in England and Wales must be licensed with Animal and Plant Health Agency; 1.2 Animal and Plant Health Agency will issue a licence number that must be used on all correspondence relating to an application; 1.3 The variety must have been accepted onto the UK National List as an agricultural conservation variety; 1.4 The seed must be produced from a crop grown in the region of origin specified for the variety at National Listing. Additional regions for crop and seed production may be authorised by Animal and Plant Health Agency; 1.5 The seed may only be marketed and used in the stated region of origin.
• Species • Variety • Field identification • Field area • Address of crop • Address of company responsible for the crop and marketing of seed produced from it 3. Quantitative restrictions 3.1 Marketing of conservation varieties is subject to quantitative restrictions. For each conservation variety no more than 0.3% or 0.5% (depending on species) of the UK’s total for that species or a quantity necessary to sow 100ha, whichever is the greater.

3.3 Animal and Plant Health Agency will estimate seed production from the crops registered by 30 April each year. It may be necessary to restrict the seed crop areas approved for production.
4. Seed marketing procedures 4.1 The seed must, with the exception of varietal purity, meet the standards specified in the technical sections of this guide for the end generation of the species concerned.
4.2 Seed must be produced in homogenous lots and not exceeding the maximum weight specified in the technical sections of this guide. For cereals, this is 30 tonnes.
4.3 A sample from every seed lot marketed must be taken and retained for two years and kept available for official monitoring. The retained sample must meet the minimum weight specified in the technical sections of this guide. For cereals, this is 1 kg.
4.4 Seed must be marketed in sealed packages or containers.
4.5 Each package or container must be labelled with a supplier’s label coloured brown.
The information required on the label is:
• The words ‘EU rules and standards’ • Name and address, or registration number, of the company responsible for the seed or its identification mark • Year of sealing, expressed as ‘sealed...’ (year) • Species • Name of the conservation variety • The words ‘conservation variety’ • The region of origin • Region of seed production where this is different from region of origin • Reference number of the seed lot • The declared net or gross weight or declared number of seeds • Where weight is indicated and granulated pesticides, pelleting substances or other solid additives are used, the nature of the chemical treatment or additive and the approximate ratio between the weight of clusters of pure seeds and the total weight.
5. Reporting, record keeping and official monitoring 5.1 By 30 April of each year, applicants must supply Animal and Plant Health Agency with the amount of seed of each conservation variety marketed in the preceding 12 months.
5.4 Applicants are required to retain records for a minimum of three years of their transactions in seeds and of the treatment, testing and other operations undertaken in relation to the marketing of conservation varieties. Samples of seed must be retained for two years.
5.3 Plant Health and Seed Inspectors may, as part of their enforcement duties, visit applicants to audit records and to take samples from seed marketed.
5.4 Seed crops of a conservation variety may be check inspected by officials.

Annex 10 – Guidelines for marketing Green Cover Mixtures in England and Wales 1 Green cover crop mixtures can be used as spring sown for summer usage, autumn sown for over-winter usage, intercropping and longer term fertility improvement. Green cover crops can significantly improve the output of agricultural rotations by improving the health of the soil.
2 Legislation Mixtures for marketing in the UK can contain seed of species covered by the regulations and those not regulated. For those green cover mixtures containing seed of species covered by the regulations, the seed must be fully certified according to the standards set out in the Seed Marketing Regulations, which will include having achieved the purity and germination standards.
i) Large Packages Labelled with a Green Official Mixture Label (weights more than 10 kg).
ii) Small Packages EU ‘A’ up to 2kg and EU ‘B’ packages up to 10kg would have a supplier’s label.
3 Labelling a mixture i) Official Labels Information required as defined in the Seed Marketing Regulations, Schedule 3, Part 2, regulation 9. The labels must contain the words ‘Mixture of Seed for Green Cover’.
ii) Supplier’s Labels Information required as defined in the Seed Marketing Regulations, Schedule 3, Part 4, regulations 21 and 23. The labels must contain the words ‘Mixture of Seed for Green Cover’.
Note Mixtures containing non-regulated black oats (Avena strigosa Schreb - Black or Bristle oats) would be acceptable in the UK, but not in the EU as black oats are a species listed in the Cereal Directive.
Mixtures for environmental use - please refer to the procedure for Preservation Mixtures in Annex 7.
This procedure does not cover wild bird seed.

Under the Plant Health Directive (2000/29/EC), certain material traded within and between Member States must be accompanied by a ‘plant passport’. Plant passports provide confirmation that material is free from quarantine pests and diseases when traded or moved and that certain conditions laid down in the Directive have been complied with.
Commission Directive 2005/16/EC extended the plant passporting arrangements to certified seeds of Sunflower - Helianthus annuus L. (all categories), Tomato - Solanum lycopersicum L. (all categories), French Beans - Phaseolus L. (all categories) and Lucerne - Medicago sativa L. (all categories). These seeds already have an official label as part of the certification arrangements under the Seed Marketing Directives; for these species only this label can also be deemed to be the plant passport subject to the addition of the words ‘EU Plant Passport’. In the case of Lucerne - Medicago sativa L, as all categories of seeds are covered by the plant passporting arrangements, any seed that is traded or moved that does not have an official certification label must have the required information added to the accompanying trade documentation.
If you are involved in the marketing of the seeds mentioned above, please contact your local Plant Health and Seeds Inspector (PHSI) who will explain the plant passporting requirements to you.
CHEMICAL TREATMENT STATED ON SEED LABELS If any seed has been subjected to any chemical treatment, this fact and the nature of the treatment or proprietary name of the chemical used must be stated on the label. This includes any samples of seed, that comprise all or a proportion of treated seed and are being sent to a Seed Testing Station.

Directives. If material is not available for a control plot to be sown, the crop cannot be inspected by a licensed inspector and must be officially inspected.
2.4 A proportion of seed lots from pre-basic and basic crops inspected by licensed inspectors must be selected for post-control for varietal identity and purity.
2.5 Pre-basic and basic seed from crops approved by licensed inspectors must be clearly identified.
2.6 APHA must report results annually to the European Commission and other Member States.
3. Licensing of Crop Inspectors 3.1 The criteria for licensed inspectors of crops entered to produce pre-basic and basic seed are:
• Minimum of three years’ experience as a licensed inspector for CS/C1/C2 crops of the relevant species.
• Assessment every two years with pass marks of 70% for the practical examination and 80% for the theory examination (the same as for NIAB and PHSI official inspectors).
3.2 Companies are asked to nominate licensed inspectors intending to inspect pre-basic and basic crops in the forthcoming season.
3.3 Those licensed inspectors examined in the previous two years meeting the above agreed pass marks will be considered by NIAB through a review of Cert 3 reports for CS/C1/C2 crops and the results of check inspections. Based on NIAB’s recommendation, APHA will issue a letter of variation which will add the inspection of pre-basic and basic crops to the licence. These inspectors will be required to attend for re-examination in one or two years (depending on date of last examination).
• Inspectors last examined over two years ago must attend for re-examination by NIAB in the current year and gain the higher pass marks before licences can be amended.
• Inspectors approved in the current year to undertake inspections of pre-basic and basic crops will be eligible the following year for the same species providing their assessments are up to date. Those inspectors should contact NIAB to register their participation each year.
3.4 The licensed inspector training and examinations have been changed to accommodate the higher level required for inspection of pre-basic and basic crops.
4 Crop entry 4.1 Crop entries should be registered on ESP or manually as usual.
Attach a letter to the payment sheet listing any official pre-basic and basic crops you intend to inspect using Licensed Official Inspectors.
Adjust the ESP/Cert2A payment sheet to reflect the change in price for a licensed official Dec 2016 Page 130 of 136

inspection.
NOTE • Licensed official inspections will be charged at £16 per hectare • For crops less than one hectare there will be a minimum charge of £16 per crop • Forward payment sheet and letter to NIAB (ACC) Cambridge.
Any crops sown with late samples or for crops of imported varieties or varieties which are unfamiliar to NIAB and where no standard reference sample exists in a control plot, the inspection must be carried out by an official inspector from NIAB or PHSI.
Crop entries should be made in the usual way on ESP or manually. You must inform NIAB if you intend to use licensed inspectors to inspect higher grade crops. NIAB will deal with applications and fees manually.
4.2 When a pre-basic and basic crop has been accepted by NIAB for licensed inspection, it is the applicant’s responsibility to ensure that the crop is inspected by an appropriately qualified inspector. It will not be possible to certify seed from crops which are not inspected.
4.3 As part of the crop entry procedure, NIAB will verify whether there is a control plot of the sown seed. If there is no control plot, crops sown with the seed can only be approved by an official inspector.
4.4 Where the sown seed lot has been imported and there is no standard sample to authenticate the variety, any pre-basic and basic crops sown with the seed must be officially inspected.
5. Information from control plots 5.1 Control plots are an important part of the certification process and a requirement for approval of pre-basic and basic crops by licensed inspectors.
When a varietal identity or significant varietal purity issue is identified in a control plot, crops sown with the seed will automatically require official inspection by NIAB or PHSI. However, it is essential that the licensed inspection continues to ensure sufficient monitoring of the temporary experiment.
5.2 NIAB will continue to send plot reports to applicants.
6. Official Check Inspection 6.1 Initially, pre-basic and basic crops of cereals and oilseeds will be subject to a 10% official check inspection rate by NIAB and PHSI. It is hoped that the level of check inspection can be reduced systematically over subsequent years if the results of first and second years are favourable.
6.2 Other species will be subject to a 20% check inspection rate. Species covered by the Vegetable Seed Marketing Directives remain at 20%.
6.3 The objective of official check inspections is to monitor the performance of licensed inspectors. NIAB will select crops to ensure that check inspections are carried out over a range of species, locations, companies and inspectors. The primary comparison will be between the official and licensed inspector’s Cert 3 reports.

MIXTURES OF SEED STANDARD VEGETABLE SEED MIXTURES The Seed Marketing Regulations and the EU Directives permit the marketing of a mixture of different varieties of standard seed of the same species. The vegetable species for which a mixture of varieties is permitted and the relevant packet weights for seed are defined in regulation 18 of the Seed Marketing Regulations 2011.
If you want to include other species, including those outside the Regulations, these may be included but must be separated from the Regulated vegetable species e.g. in a separate foil packet. The proportion of any non-Regulated species included in the packet should be stated, along with Regulated species, as part of the labelling information (see below).
Labelling The labelling requirements for mixtures of vegetable species is defined in Schedule 3, Part 4, 25 (5) of the regulations and includes:
• The words ‘mixture of varieties of...[name of species]’; • Varieties; • The proportion of the varieties, expressed as net weight or as number of seeds; • Name, address and identification number of the person attaching the label; and • Reference number of the lot /batch from which the seed was packed.

i. Mixtures of species of cereal seed only where a specific mixture of various varieties of one species of seed that as a mixture is effective against the propagation of a harmful organism and mixtures of different species the components of which all complied with the Regulations prior to mixing.
ii. A mixture of different varieties of standard seed of the same species.
Please note - no other combinations of mixtures are permitted.
SEED CERTIFICATION ENTRIES LATE CROP ENTRIES Applicants are reminded of the importance of meeting the closing dates for crop entries. The purpose of a crop entry is to give notification to NIAB that seed has been sown and to provide details of the crops sown and from which seed lot. This information is a requirement of the Seed Marketing Regulations. Closing dates by which crop entries and fees must be sent to NIAB are given in Appendix 2 of this Guide. Only in exceptional circumstances will late entries be accepted e.g. due to extreme weather conditions or other conditions outside the applicant’s control. Late entries cause more work for NIAB which results in additional costs.
If NIAB are unable to register a crop entry as acceptable because of a delay in making the entry or paying the fees this has the effect of delaying the processing of high category crops for official inspection.
APHA will take a firm line against companies who persistently fail to submit crop entries by the required closing date and will write to applicants whose entry has not been accepted.
SEED LOT WEIGHTS MAXIMUM WEIGHT OF A SEED LOT OF CERTAIN FODDER PLANT SPECIES Commission Implementing Directive 2012/37/EU amends the Fodder Plant Seed Directive with regard to the maximum seed lot weight for Poaceae (Gramineae) (Grasses) species.
The maximum weight may be increased to 25 tonnes if the supplier has been authorised for this purpose by the Certifying Authority (APHA).
TEMPORARY LICENCE FOR THE MARKETING OF POPULATIONS OF WHEAT, BARLEY, OATS AND MAIZE Commission Implementing Decision 2014/150/EU details the temporary experiment providing for certain derogations for the marketing of populations of plant species of wheat, barley, oats and maize. A temporary licence no. 2014/01 has been issued.
IMPORTS OF SEED IMPORTS OF SEED WEIGHING OVER 2KG FROM THIRD COUNTRIES If you import seed, even occasionally, from a Third Country (non-EU) for first marketing in England and Wales and the package weighs over 2kg then you are obliged, under the Seed Dec 2016 Page 134 of 136


---
Marketing Regulations 2011, to provide specific information relating to the seed you have imported. You should therefore:- 1) Complete a current ITC1 form information sheet to supply the following details - Species; Variety; Category; Country of production and the official inspection authority; Country of despatch; Importer; and Quantity of seed.
This information should be supplied on a monthly basis. If no seed has been imported in any month a Nil response is required. Please note that the form is in Excel format for ease of completion and should be sent to the Seed Marketing Team by email (not as a PDF) to (seed.cert@apha.gsi.gov.uk).
Where Third Country seed is imported into another Member State first and then marketed to England or Wales, it is not necessary to provide APHA with information as the company in the other Member State should make a return to their Certifying Authority.
Standard Vegetable Seed - Standard vegetable seed must be included in the return. If ‘Country of Production’ is not known, this should be marked ‘not known’ or ‘n/k’ and the ‘Country of Despatch’ column completed with the name of the country exporting the seed into England or Wales.
Seed In Large Outer Containers - Packages under 2kg contained within a larger outer packet which exceeds 2kg must be included regardless of whether each small packet is of different seed. Details of the contents of each small packet must be entered.
1) Complete the ITC2 consent form (consent is voluntary, however providing the import data is a requirement).
2) If you consent, the information collected by the seed marketing team of APHA may be released to other sections of APHA including the GM team which monitors Third Country imports of conventional seed for adventitious GM presence.
Please contact APHA if you need the ITC 1 or 2 form.
IMPORTED SEED FROM 3RD COUNTRIES – EQUIVALENCE REQUIREMENTS The European Commission has raised concerns regarding the imports of agricultural seed into the UK from third (non-EU) countries.
I am writing to remind all companies which import seed from third countries of their obligations under EU Directives and the Seed Marketing Regulations 2011:- • Seed being imported from outside the EU, officially certified or for final certification, can only be brought into the UK from countries which the EU recognises as having crop inspection and seed production standards equivalent to those in the EU i.e.
‘Equivalent Third Countries’.
• Equivalence arrangements only apply to agricultural species and for vegetable seed marketing only.
• The seed must be produced under the OECD Seed Scheme appropriate to the species and the variety must be on the OECD list of varieties eligible for certification.
Dec 2016 Page 135 of 136


---
The Plant Health and Seeds Inspectors (PHSIs) will be checking any third country seed, during their visits to licensed seed companies, to ensure that the seed has been imported from an Equivalent country and a return has been made to APHA for any seed over 2Kg in weight.
The following table gives a summary of the species eligible for importation from countries under the Equivalence arrangements:
IMPORTED BLENDED SEED LOTS – SAMPLING AND TESTING There have been some recent cases of imported seed lots being blended in the UK and entered for certification without being sampled or tested. Seed officially certified in another EU Member State or an Equivalent third country and imported for further multiplication, must be sampled by a Licensed seed sampler or an Official seed sampler. The sample must be submitted direct to NIAB with the form CERT 5 attached. The CERT 5 should be marked ‘For verification only’.
