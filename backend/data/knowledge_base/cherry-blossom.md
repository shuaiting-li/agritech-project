Cherry blossom trees are perfectly adapted to life in the UK, and you should find that they do very well in your garden.

The first thing to consider is the size. These trees can get up to 30 feet tall, so ensure that you have enough space for them! There are varieties that are smaller and more suitable if you lack space in your garden (e.g. Prunus Amanogawa).
They like a full sun position ideally, but will also tolerate some partial shade conditions.
Find a sheltered spot for your cherry blossom tree, as most cultivars are grafted onto rootstocks, meaning the roots can be a little weak.
Soil condition doesn’t matter too much, but you will need to ensure that the soil is well-draining, so the roots don’t get too soggy.
Dig a hole that is three times the radius of the root ball and a few inches deeper. Place the tree into the hole, ensuring the top roots are no more than an inch below the soil.
Fill the hole with a mixture of garden soil and compost, and add a layer of mulch, for nutrients and protection.
It is a good idea to plant a stake or a small supporting fence, to keep your cherry tree stable and to discourage rabbits nibbling at the bark.
Once you have planted your cherry tree into the ideal spot, you will need to keep on top of your watering regime. Young cherry trees need plenty of water to help them recover from the shock of transplanting.
Cherry blossom trees are light feeders, but they will benefit from a general purpose granular plant food in the spring, before any serious flowering has taken place.
Your tree should settle in and start to establish itself before too long, and you will soon be able to enjoy those beautiful blossoms!
Here is a useful little article if you want to know more about how to grow cherry blossom trees.

How Quickly Do Cherry Blossom Trees Grow?
Although these trees do reach impressive heights, you will have a little time before they get really large.

Cherry blossom trees can grow up to 33 feet in height, and can have a spread of up to 16 feet.

They can take 10-15 years to reach their final height; they are fairly slow-growing, meaning that you have plenty of time to establish whether the space you picked was big enough!

With the right conditions, your cherry blossom tree will grow as it should; however if it is too shaded or waterlogged, it will not do as well.

Can Cherry Blossom Trees Grow In Pots?
Although these are typically quite large trees that reach a good size, some species can actually be grown in pots if you cannot plant them out.

Cherry trees, if planted out and in the right conditions, can reach over 30 feet tall – but putting any plant in a pot will restrict its growth.

If you are determined to keep your cherry tree to a manageable size for a pot, a good pruning regime is essential, to stop it growing too large.

Make sure you get a good big pot, otherwise the roots won’t have any space and your tree will likely die.

As with a cherry tree planted out, keeping it well watered is a key to its good health and ability to thrive.

Cherry blossom trees in pots will need more feeding than those in the ground; they will benefit from a high potassium fertiliser every couple of weeks in the spring and summer.

Choose yourself one of the smaller varieties that should be more suited to growing in a container environment, and you will soon see that cherry blossom trees can thrive in pots!

What Is The Average Lifespan Of A Cherry Blossom Tree?
These beautiful trees, because they ultimately grow pretty big, seem as though they would last for many years… But sadly this is not the case.

On average, a cherry blossom tree will live to between 15 and 25 years, given the right conditions and care.

However, if they are kept in the perfect conditions for them, they have been known to reach between 30 and 40 years of age.

This is a great incentive to get the conditions just right, isn’t it? Then you can enjoy this beautiful tree for many years to come!

Why Is My Cherry Blossom Tree Not Flowering?
Because the flowers are so strikingly pretty, we want these tress to bloom as much as possible. If yours isn’t, there can be many reasons why:

Not enough sunlight. These trees do like to be kept warm and bright, and if they are not getting enough sun then they will feel sorry for themselves and won’t live their best life.
Late frosts. Although they are fairly hardy, cherry trees don’t like to be caught out by a surprise frost once they have started to produce leaves.
A warm winter. Conversely, cherry trees need to spend a certain amount of time being cold in the dormant months. If the winter has been particularly mild, the flowers of the following year may be affected.
Diseases. Cherry blossom trees are susceptible to rot, powdery mildew, blight and canker, all of which can affect flowering. You can treat these problems with a fungicide from a garden centre.
It generally takes just a few weeks for flowers to appear on your cherry blossom tree after budding, so if you don’t see any when you expect, it is definitely worth checking the health of the plant and its conditions.

Final Words
These beautiful trees are a wonderful addition to any garden, no matter what else you have planted in there.

Hopefully, now that you have a good idea of how to grow cherry blossom tree, your garden will be a riot of colourful blossoms any day now!
