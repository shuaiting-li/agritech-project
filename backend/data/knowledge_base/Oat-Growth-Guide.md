OAT GROWTH GUIDE An output from OPTIMISING GROWTH TO MAXIMISE YIELD AND QUALITY


---
INTRODUCTION Demand for high quality UK oats for food use continues to increase, but research has indicated that there is a yield gap of approximately 4 t/ha between average and best on-farm oat yields.
To ensure growers and agronomists have the best available information, a consortium of leading industry and academic partners came together to form the Opti-Oat project. Under the leadership of PepsiCo and with co-funding from Innovate UK and BBSRC this project has developed the first UK Oat Growth Guide.
This Oat Growth Guide is designed to increase understanding of winter and spring oats through crop growth and development benchmarks, with the aim of improving yield and quality to deliver a sustainable supply and maximise grower returns.

MANAGING KEY POINTS OAT CROPS To manage a crop, a cycle of setting targets, assessment, adjustment and monitoring is needed.
The Oat Growth Guide is designed to provide benchmarks that can be used to monitor the success of crop management to achieve good yields.
NCH The Oat Growth Guide is not E M designed to give advice on B individual management A decisions.
R Benchmarks are numerical values that K describe the growth and development of a high yielding crop. Whilst benchmarks should not necessarily be considered S targets as they may vary across seasons, different management practices and growing conditions, they can be used by growers as a tool for crop improvement to:
1. SET TARGETS 2. ASSESS PROGRESS AGAINST BENCHMARKS 3. MODIFY HUSBANDRY, WHERE POSSIBLE, 4. RE-ASSESS CROP TO MEET TARGETS PROGRESS & PERFORMANCE 5. ADJUST FUTURE CROP MANAGEMENT OAT GROWTH GUIDE 4

BENCHMARKS DEVELOPING THE BENCHMARKS The benchmarks in this guide were developed using data from experiments carried out in England, Scotland and Wales over four growing seasons (harvests 2014-2017). These ‘reference’ trials examined winter and spring husked milling oat varieties. The trial sites are represented by the blue squares on the map.
The benchmarks for winter and spring oats are presented in separate sections of this guide.
Where the data indicate different crop performance in different regions of the UK (North vs South), benchmarks are displayed separately.
In addition to the intensively-measured ‘reference’ experiments, commercial fields of Mascani (70 fields) and Canyon (47 fields) were monitored across four years (locations represented by the red symbols on the map). Key data from these fields are displayed throughout the guide where appropriate.
WINTER OATS (LIGHT BLUE PAGE HEADERS) The benchmarks in the winter oats section of the guide are associated with a cv. Mascani crop yielding 8.1 t/ha at 15% moisture. The dwarf variety Balado was also monitored and comparative data for this variety are displayed where there are relevant differences to Mascani.
SPRING OATS (DARK GREEN PAGE HEADERS) The benchmarks in the spring oats section of the guide are associated with a cv. Canyon crop Reference sites yielding 7.0 t/ha at 15% moisture.

whereas development is dependent on variety choice.
Growth can be managed by optimising green canopy size.
This can be achieved by modifying management practices throughout the season e.g. seed rate, nutrition, disease control and application of plant growth regulators.
DEVELOPMENT Development is measured as progress through Winter oats generally require a period of cold growth stages and can only be altered by variety and (vernalisation) to induce flowering. However, sowing date. The rate of development is affected by: unlike winter wheat, this is not an obligate Temperature – warmer temperatures lead to a requirement, so winter oat varieties that are greater rate of development not vernalised will flower eventually.

However where soil is very wet, aeration becomes limiting and can reduce germination. A minimum accumulation of temperature is required to reach specific growth stages.
This is measured using thermal time (°C days), the accumulated mean daily temperature from sowing. As daily temperatures decline in autumn, it takes longer to accumulate the required thermal time and so takes longer for crops to emerge.

TILLERING Tillering starts when a few leaves have emerged and continues until the start of stem extension. Tillering is affected by seed rate, temperature and the availability of water and nutrients. Applying N before stem extension generally increases tillering whereas applying N later can improve tiller survival.
SHOOT SURVIVAL AND FINAL SHOOT NUMBERS Maximum shoot number almost always exceeds final shoot number. Smaller, later–formed tillers die off as competition for light and nitrogen increases throughout the season. In the South, a higher proportion of tillers survive than in the North.

NITROGEN UPTAKE PATTERN OF N UPTAKE Nitrogen uptake is low through the winter but speeds up from mid-March when the warmer weather accelerates canopy expansion and tillering. Between GS31 and 39, the rate of N uptake is at its greatest as the crop canopy size increases. Uptake slows down after GS39 when the crop moves into panicle formation.
By GS87, a benchmark crop takes up 205 kg N/ha. Total N in crop at harvest = 205 kg/ha of which grain = 70% straw/chaff = 30% N REDISTRIBUTION TO GRAIN There is a significant redistribution of N within the crop during grain-filling; proteins in leaves are degraded and N is transferred up the plant to form grain protein. This, rather than root uptake, is the main source of grain N during grain-filling.
At GS87, straw and chaff contain 61 kg N/ha, 93 kg/ha less than at GS59.

CANOPY EXPANSION Growth is slower over the winter period so the canopy expands slowly between drilling and GS30.
Between GS31 and GS39 canopy expansion is at its most rapid, with GAI increasing by 1 unit every 11-12 days. GAI peaks at GS59, then starts to decrease between GS59 and GS75 as the canopy senesces.

STEM EXTENSION & FINAL HEIGHT KEY POINTS Height is dictated by variety but also affected by environmental and management factors.
Lodging control is an important HEIGHT OF OATS aspect of the management of There are two distinct types of oat varieties – conventional oats. conventional and dwarf, and these differ significantly in their height, with dwarf varieties generally 15-20 cm shorter than conventional varieties. For consistency, the heights quoted in this guide are measured to the flag leaf ligule unless otherwise stated.
Oat stems are typically made up of six internodes, with the internode below the peduncle at the top of the plant being the longest and those at the bottom of the stem the shortest. Stem extension starts at GS30 and the internodes continue to grow until final crop height is achieved at GS75.
Panicle extrusion (above the flag leaf ligule) varies between crops, varieties and variety types. Generally, panicles are higher above the flag leaf on taller oat cultivars.
Final height Mean = 104 cm (top of panicle) North = 100 cm DWARF OATS (BALADO) - NO PGR APPLIED South = 109 cm LODGING Conventional height oats are seen as more prone to lodging than wheat and barley as oats are often taller than other cereals. However, more modern varieties are less prone to lodging as they have stronger, slightly shorter stems. Generally, oats do have thicker stems and stem walls and better anchorage strength (greater root plate width and depth) than wheat.
The Mascani crops grown in these reference trials received a robust programme of plant growth regulators (PGRs). Dwarf oats should not receive PGRs as this can make them taller. Oats can also be affected by brackling (buckling of the middle Final height Mean = 87 cm (top of panicle) North = 85 cm internodes). This doesn’t usually affect yields or South = 89 cm harvest, but can affect grain quality.

Oat screenings consist of small and broken grains plus crop debris.
Screenings due to small grains is determined by a combination of plant variety genetics and weather during the growing season. Crop debris is influenced by combine set-up at harvest. High levels of screenings can reduce milling throughput, and so screening percentages should be considered when selecting varieties for milling end use.

NITROGEN UPTAKE PATTERN OF N UPTAKE Total N in crop at harvest = 157 kg/ha In spring oats, the rate of nitrogen uptake is of which grain = 76% consistent up to GS59. As the crop is sown in straw/chaff = 24% warmer spring conditions, growth and N uptake can start rapidly.
By GS87, a benchmark crop takes up 157 kg N/ha.
N REDISTRIBUTION TO GRAIN There is a significant redistribution of N within the crop during grain-filling; proteins in leaves are degraded and N is transferred up the plant to form grain protein. This, rather than root uptake, is the main source of grain N during grain-filling.
At GS87, straw and chaff contain 38 kg N/ha, 75 kg/ha less than at GS59.

CANOPY EXPANSION The canopy expands slowly from drilling until GS31 as growth is slow.
Between GS31 and GS39 expansion is at it’s most rapid, with GAI increasing by 1 unit every 11-12 days. GAI peaks at GS59, then starts to decrease between GS59 and GS75 as canopy senescence occurs.

For consistency, the heights quoted in this guide are measured to the flag leaf ligule unless otherwise stated.
LODGING Spring oats can be affected by lodging, although not as significantly as winter oats, and more modern varieties are generally less prone to lodging as they have stronger, slightly shorter stems.
The Canyon crops grown in these reference trials received a robust programme of plant growth regulators (PGRs). Oats can also be affected by brackling (buckling of the middle internodes). This doesn’t usually affect yields or harvest, but can have a negative effect on grain quality.

GLOSSARY Pollination: Reception of pollen produced in the anthers (bearing the male genetic complement) by the stigma, leading to fertilisation of the ovum (bearing the female genetic complement). Fertilisation of oats normally occurs within one floret, rather than between florets.
Rachis: The portion of the stem within the panicle (above the neck), bearing the rachillas and spikelets.
Ripening: The changes that occur in the grain between completion of growth and maturity. These include drying, and development and loss of dormancy. Grain is considered ‘ripe’ when it is ready for harvest – at less than 20% moisture.
Screenings: A by-product of the process of cleaning oats which includes anything that passes through a 2 mm slotted sieve.
Senescence: Loss of greenness in photosynthetic tissues, normally brought about by ageing, but also by nutrient withdrawal, disease or drought.
Shoots: All the axes of a plant with the potential to bear a panicle, including the main shoot and all tillers. Shoots retaining the potential to form grain are termed ‘fertile shoots'.
Specific weight: The weight of grain (corrected for variation in moisture content) when packed into a standard container.
It is expressed in kilograms per hectolitre (100 litres). It is also referred to as ’bulk density’ or 'bushel weight'.
Spikelet: The primary sub-component of the panicle. Each spikelet is contained within two glumes and consists of several fertile florets. Around 20 spikelets are borne on alternate sides of the panicle stem or ‘rachis’, and there is one ‘terminal spikelet’.
Thermal time: The sum of the mean daily temperatures (mean of maximum and minimum) in the time period related to a specific development process. The accumulation begins after a base temperature is reached, e.g. for leaf development the base temperature is 0 ºC, below this development ceases. Thermal time is expressed in ‘degree days’ (ºC days).
Tiller: A side shoot borne from the main shoot.
Vernalisation: A change in the physiological state of a plant from vegetative to reproductive brought about by a period of cold – can be applied to seeds or (in the case of wheat) to the young plant.
Waterlogging: Filling of soil pores with water to the extent that there is insufficient oxygen for normal root function.
