WWeellccoommee Welcome to the Red Tractor Assurance for Farms – Combinable Crops and Sugar Beet Scheme Standards, part of the Red Tractor Food Assurance Scheme assuring food safety, animal welfare, hygiene and environmental protection through every part of the food chain.
These Standards have been written and revised by our Technical Advisory Committees (TACs) in consultation with customers, farmer representatives and the wider industry to ensure they are clear and provide meaningful, credible farm assurance for all. This is essential with the increasing demand for traceability of food, growing consumer awareness of animal welfare issues in livestock production and a need to minimise pesticide residues.
For more information about the Red Tractor Assurance Scheme visit w.redtractorassurance.org.uk GUIDE Scheme members are advised this manual must be read in conjunction with the ‘How the Red Tractor Assurance Scheme Works’ leaflet which details the Rules of the Scheme that all members are bound by.
The standards are organised in sections. The AIM of each standard or group of standards is clearly explained. All of the words against each standard including the column ‘How you will be measured’ form part of the standard.
Standard coding begins with a two letter prefix that identifies the section (e.g. EC for Environmental Protection and Contamination Control). Assessors will use this code together with a code to identify the enterprise to which it relates (e.g. CR for Combinable Crops and Sugar Beet) to identify any non-conformances on the report at the end of the assessment.
Key – those standards which have greater significance (all other standards are normal) Recommendation – those which do not affect certification New – a completely new standard which the member must now adhere to Revised – a standard that has changed and requires the member to take some different or additional action to before Upgraded – the standard has been upgraded to a Key standard or from a Recommendation to a full standard Appendix – this is referenced in the ‘How you will be measured’ column and indicates that additional information is provided in the Appendices at the back of this manual R - this icon indicates that a record is required Where to find help - at the end of each section we have indicated where you can get extra guidance if you need it.
(Our interactive pdf version of this document available on w.redtractorassurance.org.uk will automatically take you to the right documents and sources of more help).

In sugar beet crops the applicator must be able to turn off the flow of granules before the row end n Designated areas for filling hoppers in each field are used which can easily be checked for spillages. Spillages should be dealt with accroding to manufacturer recommendations and the NSP Protocol to ensure no granules are left on the surface n Treated fields are checked 24-48 hours after application for any adverse effects to wildlife.

Appendix VC.b VERMIN CONTROL Site Survey A site survey is a record of every inspection and/or survey undertaken; inspecting the farm for signs of rodent activity or environmental management requirements. The site survey must outline the following:
n Date of inspection n Locations inspected n Findings (including type, level and extent of infestation and all potential opportunities e.g. feed spills/gaps/habitats) n Actions required (including what needs to be completed and by whom) n Date completed (initials to verify) Where the site survey identifies a rodent infestation, the concept of a ‘risk hierarchy’ must be used when considering the rodent control strategy. This means considering the use of non-chemical control methods first, followed by the least toxic alternatives.
Risk Hierarchy Non-chemical – lethal First generation anticoagulants Second generation anticoagulants Other control methods Environmental Risk Assessment Where actions are identified as part of the site survey which involve the use of rodenticides, an environmental risk assessment must be carried out. The risk assessment must cover the following:
n What the treatment is designed to achieve, what methods of rodent control will be used and how success will be measured n Which non-target species may be present in or near the treatment site n What steps have been/will be taken to prevent, or adequately control, exposure of wildlife/domestic pets and the environment n How dead rodents and rodenticides will be disposed of n Once the infestation has been removed/controlled, what measures can be implemented to prevent re-infestation Red Tractor Assurance for Farms – Combinable Crops and Sugar Beet Standards © Assured Food Standards 2020 20

Appendix VC.b (continued) VERMIN CONTROL Bait Plan A plan must be in place to control vermin and records must be kept of baits used and checks made. The plan should be completed by the person with responsibility for vermin management and must be kept up-to-date. The plan must be kept for 2 years following changes.
The bait plan must cover the following:
n Map of bait point locations n Bait used n Bait point inspection and replenishment dates COSHH Assessment The Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002 (the COSHH assessment) requires assessments are carried out to identify any risks to operators and others who may be affected by treatments involving hazardous substances. The Health and Safety Executive provide an e-tool for completing the COSHH assessment, which can be found here: http://coshh-tool.hse.gov.uk/.

Appendix EC.m SAFE APPLICATIONS TO LAND This appendix provides guidance on making applications to land. All applications to land must be carried out in accordance with legislation. Environmental Permits or exemptions must be held where applicable. If your farm is in an NVZ you must also follow NVZ rules. The Environment Agency website has information on spreading waste on land which may be helpful.
Note: Producers should always check with buyers to ensure that any applications of sludge, compost, digestate and other materials originating outside the farm are acceptable to customers.
Sewage Sludge (biosolids) The Biosolids Assurance Scheme was established by the UK water industry. The scheme details comprehensive controls for the treatment and recycling of biosolids to ensure sewage sludge derived products are safe to use and pose no threat to the food chain, consumers and the environment.
Untreated sewage sludge has not been permitted on any agricultural land since 2006.
Treated sewage sludges can only be used under strictly controlled conditions. Prior to application the soil must be tested by the sludge supplier. Applications of sewage sludge to land must be in accordance with suppliers’ instructions (i.e. the way the sludge has been treated may affect where and when the sludge can be applied).
Two types of treated sewage sludge are permitted by the scheme:
1. Conventionally treated sludge - has been subjected to defined treatment processes and standards that ensure at least 99% of pathogens have been destroyed. The most common form of treatment is anaerobic digestion.
2. Enhanced treated sludge - will be free from Salmonella and will have been treated so as to ensure that 99.9999% of pathogens present in the original sludge have been destroyed.
Farmyard Manure (FYM) and Slurry – Fresh, Stored or Treated Batch storage of solid manures and slurries for at least 6 months (that is with no additions of fresh manure made to the store during this period) or ‘active’ treatment, are effective methods of killing pathogens. Composting of solid manures is a particularly effective method of controlling microbial pathogens, but for best results the process needs to be actively managed. The manure should be treated as a batch and turned regularly (at least twice within the first 7 days) either with a front-end loader or preferably with a purpose-built compost turner. This should generate high temperatures over a period of time (e.g. above 55°C for 3 days) which are effective in killing pathogens and this temperature should be monitored. Allow the compost to mature as part of the treatment process. The whole process should last at least 3 months.
Lime treatment of slurry (addition of quick lime or slaked lime to raise the pH to 12 for at least 2 hours) is an effective method of inactivating bacterial pathogens. Allow the slurry to mature as part of the batch treatment process for at least 3 months prior to land spreading.
Although pathogens can be killed by exposure to sunlight, you should incorporate manures into the soil as soon as is practicable. This will reduce the potential for direct crop contamination as well as reduce odour and ammonia emissions.
Compost, Digestates and other Recycled Materials It is recommended that digestates and composts sourced from external contractors for application to land have been produced to the relevant PAS specification (PAS 110 for digestate, PAS 100 for compost) and are applied following the associated Quality Protocol. The specifications and Quality Protocols provide safeguards on the feedstock materials, the processing stages and end product quality.
Where anaerobic digestate is produced from an energy crop feedstock (e.g. maize) and there is no pasteurisation step there is a risk that plant pathogens, for example Fusarium spp., may be present. It is recommended that energy crop digestate is ploughed in before drilling a subsequent cereal crop.

Appendix EC.m MANURE MANAGEMENT PLAN Standard EC.m requires a Manure Management Plan to be kept and followed when applying manures and/or slurries to land. Where land falls in an NVZ, a completed and more detailed plan should already be in place and will meet the scheme requirements.
The scheme recommends the use of the Tried and Tested website (w.nutrientmanagement.org) for resources, templates and in the development of your Manure Management Plan.
As a minimum, all holdings must have a Manure Management Plan that:
n includes a farm map identifying where and when manure can/ cannot be applied. The map must show the areas stated in table A – and it is recommended that colour coding is used n includes calculations of the Total Area Required to apply the manure/ slurry produced without exceeding a total nitrogen application rate of 250kg/ha/year (or less as required by legislation). Use the following calculation and the hectares needed by stock unit in Table B:
– Number of stock units (by stock type) x months housed x Ha needed by stock unit = Total Area Required – E.g. 75 cows (650kg) x 6months x 0.039 = 17.55 ha required If the map and calculations prove you have a Total Spreadable Area greater than the Total Area Required, the plan is complete. If the Total Spreadable Area is less than the Total Area Required, a more detailed plan or an alternative action is necessary.

Appendix EI.c LAND USED TO PRODUCE CROPS FOR BIOFUELS, BIOLIQUIDS AND BIOMASS Summary of Requirements Producers who may supply crops into the biofuel, bioliquid and biomass supply chains must not produce from areas of land with high biodiversity or of high carbon stock or peatland (unless evidence is provided that the cultivation and harvesting does not involve drainage of previously undrained soil. This is a requirement under the Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC; articles 17(3), 17(4), 17(5).
Producers will be assessed for compliance against these requirements rather than the simplified requirements that are included in Standard EI.c Definitions Biofuels - means liquid or gaseous fuel for transport produced from biomass Bioliquids - means liquid fuel for energy purposes other than for transport, including electricity and heating or cooling, produced from biomass Biomass – means the biodegradable fraction of products, waste and residues from biological origin from agriculture (including vegetal and animal substances), forestry and related industries including fisheries and aquaculture, as well as the biodegradable fraction of industrial and municipal waste.
Requirements of Renewable Energy Directive Article 17(3) Conservation of biodiversity Biofuels and bioliquids shall not be made from raw material obtained from land with a high biodiversity value that is land that had one of the following statuses in or after January 2008 whether or not the land continues to have that status n Land that was primary forest or other wooded land Primary forest and other wooded land is defined as forest and other wooded land of native species, where there is no clearly visible indication of human activity and the ecological processes are not significantly disturbed n Areas designated:
– by law or by the relevant competent authority for nature protection purposes; or – for the protection of rare, threatened or endangered ecoystems or species recognised by international agreements or included in lists drawn up by intergovernmental organisations or the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, subject to their recognition in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 18(4) of the Renewable Energy Directive An exception is possible if evidence is provided that the production of that raw material did not interfere with those nature protection purposes n Land that was highly biodiverse grassland Highly biodiverse grassland is defined as:
– natural, namely grassland that would remain grassland in the absence of human intervention and which maintains the natural species composition and ecological characteristics and processes or – non-natural, namely grassland that would cease to be grassland in the absence of human intervention and which is species-rich and not degraded, unless evidence is provided that the harvesting of the raw material is necessary to preserve its grassland status Commission Regulation (EU) No1307/2014 establishes definitions of ‘grassland’, ‘human intervention’, ‘degraded’ and ‘species-rich’ and clarifies that grasslands in the following geographic ranges of the EU shall always be regarded as highly biodiverse grassland:
– habitats listed in Annex I to Council Directive 92/43/EEC (1) – habitats of significant importance for animal and plant species of Union interest listed in Annexes II and IV to Directive 92/43/EEC – habitats of significant importance for wild bird species listed in Annex I to Directive 2009/147/EC Red Tractor Assurance for Farms – Combinable Crops and Sugar Beet Standards © Assured Food Standards 2020 26

Appendix EI.c (continued) LAND USED TO PRODUCE CROPS FOR BIOFUELS, BIOLIQUIDS AND BIOMASS Requirements of Renewable Energy Directive Article 17(4) Conservation of carbon stocks Biofuels and bioliquids shall not be made from raw material obtained from land with high carbon stock that is, land that had one of the following statuses in January 2008 and no longer has that status n Land that was wetland – A wetland is land that is covered with or saturated by water permanently or for a significant part of the year n Land that was continuously forested – Continuously forested areas are defined as land spanning more than one hectare with trees higher than 5m and a canopy cover of more than 30% or trees able to reach those thresholds in situ – Continuously forested areas do not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use.
Agricultural land use refers to tree stands in agricultural production systems, such as fruit tree plantations, oil palm plantations and agroforestry systems when crops are grown under tree cover n Forested land with 10-30% canopy cover – Sparsely forested areas are defined as land spanning more than one hectare with trees higher than 5m and a canopy cover of between 10% and 30%, or trees able to reach those thresholds in situ, unless evidence is provided that the carbon stock of the area before and after conversion is such that, when the methodology laid down in part C of Annex V is applied, the greenhouse gas threshold set out in the Directive would still be fulfilled.
These provisions shall not apply if, at the time the raw material was obtained, the land had the same status as it had in January 2008 Requirements of Renewable Energy Directive Article 17(5) Conservation of peatlands Biofuels and bioliquids shall not be made from raw material obtained from land that was peatland in January 2008 n An exception is possible if evidence is provided that the cultivation and harvesting of that raw material does not involve drainage of previously undrained soil n For peatland that was partially drained in January 2008 a subsequent deeper drainage, affecting soil that was not fully drained, would constitute a breach of the criterion Renewable Energy Directive Documentation Requirements Documents for verification of previous land status must be retained for 5 years and made available for inspection by the assessor. Such documents may include Single Farm Payment documentation, maps or other of official records showing field location and classification/ use.
Where applicable, documents must be kept to show compliance with the Environmental Impact Assessment (Agriculture)(England)(no.2) Regulations 2006. These act to protect uncultivated land and semi-natural areas from being damaged by agricultural work, and to guard against possible negative environmental effects from the restructuring of rural land holdings. Records of an EIA must be kept for 5 years and made available for inspection by the assessor. EIA guidance can be found at Natural England http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/ publication/4038539 Documentation must include records of a mass balance system which specify the timeframe over which the system operates and include full details of any ‘carry-over’ stocks Documentation relating to wetlands must reflect seasonal changes within a year.
Post Harvest Declaration (Grain passport) For the purposes of the Renewable Energy Directive, the volume of RED- compliant raw material produced/leaving the farm must be recorded and producers must sign the related declaration on sustainability on the Post Harvest Declaration (grain passport) for crops produced on eligible land.

Appendix ST.h CIPC STORE RISK ASSESSMENT Any store in which chlorpropham (CIPC) treatments have taken place or which has contained CIPC treated potatoes for any period of time may not be suitable for the future storage of crops where no approval for the use of CIPC exists e.g. cereals. This is because the risk of CIPC contamination of the crop is possible and could lead to illegal residues contaminating the stored crop. CIPC is volatile and any stored crop can be contaminated from the atmosphere within the store without any necessity for physical contact with the floor or walls.
Vacuuming and steam cleaning a contaminated store may reduce the concentrations of CIPC on the fabric of the store. However, it will be extremely difficult to remove traces of CIPC that have penetrated into the fabric of materials.
In order to avoid the risk of having a valuable crop contaminated with CIPC it is essential to check the history of the store before use. If a comprehensive record of storage is not available and you cannot be sure that CIPC has not been used then testing of the fabric of materials within the building should be carried out before any other crops are stored.

Appendix ST.h (continued) CIPC STORE RISK ASSESSMENT Store fabric sampling method for CIPC residue analysis 1. A sample can be made up from dust, chippings of concrete from the floor, scrapings from bricks, pointing mortar, slivers of wood from the fabric, plaster board, insulation material etc. Ensure hands are washed clean before the samples are taken.
2. About 10-15 grams is required for analysis (a pile in the palm of a hand), but it is vitally important that this is as representative as possible and made up of random sub-samples taken from all around the store.
3. Contact your chosen analytical laboratory to check they can test for CIPC from fabric material and the cost.
The analytical cost should be approximately £100 per sample.
4. Put the sample in small marked and sealed plastic freezer bag in an outer jiffy bag with all your details and post to the laboratory. A number of analytical laboratories will be able to undertake this test. Examples include:

STANDARDS HOW YOU WILL BE MEASURED How the Red Tractor Assurance Scheme works The Red Tractor Assurance Scheme exists to certify and signify the conformance by each of its members to a series of integrated standards that apply to different farming enterprises and different steps in the food supply chain.
As a business operating in the farming or food supply industry, you can apply to join the Scheme for a single farming enterprise or food supply chain activity or whatever combination of enterprises or activities fits your business needs.
To become and remain a member, you must at all times conform to the standards and the membership rules (as they may both be amended by RTA from time to time).
To join the Scheme, you should contact any one of the Certification Bodies who are independent contractors, licensed by RTA to manage membership (although, for dairy farms, your first purchaser of milk will choose a Certification Body and arrange your application or transfers, as appropriate). You will find all the enterprises and activities that the Scheme covers and the Certification Bodies listed on the back page of this booklet. You can apply to join at any time throughout the year and your membership must be renewed annually. You will need to enter a contract directly with your chosen Certification Body and that contract will (in addition to these Rules) govern the terms on which your Certification Body will manage your initial application, assessment and certification against the standards and your annual renewal. The Certification Body will also be your routine point of contact.
Before applying, you are advised to carefully read the membership rules and the standards which set out what you have to do and how you will be assessed. If you operate more than one farming enterprise or food supply chain activity, you can select which of these you want to be assessed and certified1.
If applying for more than one, your Certification Body may apply a discount and will co-ordinate the assessment together in a single visit where possible. Alternatively, you can choose more than one Certification Body for the different enterprises or activities and the assessments will be carried out separately.
You may change your Certification Body at any time and still maintain ‘Red Tractor Assured’ status as long as you have no outstanding non-conformances or obligations. If you are not satisfied with the way your application, assessment or certification decision has been conducted, you may lodge an appeal in writing with your Certification Body within such time period as your Certification Body may stipulate from time to time. All appeals will be investigated and dealt with in accordance with the Certification Body’s appeal procedure or, if so directed, RTA’s appeal procedure.
Your attention is drawn in particular to the limitation of liability provisions set out in Rules 74 – 76.
1 With the exception of: (a) Dairy, where beef assurance is required for the cattle (see Rule 23); and (b) Beef and Lamb, where, if both cattle and sheep are farmed, both have to be assessed and certified.

HOW THE RED TRACTOR ASSURANCE SCHEME WORKS 1. Application Send application and fee to your chosen Certification Body detailing all the relevant holdings/ premises. Receipt will be acknowledged in 14 days and the assessment will be arranged.
Initial Assessment 2.
The assessor will talk to you about your business as you walk together around (or facilitate remote viewing via video-streaming of) the facilities, look at the livestock/crop as applicable and check your paperwork. They will need to talk to your staff too about what they do. Any areas which do not meet the Standards (which we refer to as "non-conformances") will be highlighted to you throughout the assessment. They are not allowed to advise on, or suggest, how you need to correct things. You will be left or sent a report which will contain details of any nonconformances, an indication of the evidence you will be expected to provide (e.g. invoices, photos, photocopies, letter from vet) and the timescales for action.
3. Non-conformances You must supply your Certification Body with evidence that you have corrected everything as explained in the non-conformance report. In some cases, a re-visit may be required and this may incur a charge. Your application will lapse if you do not correct everything satisfactorily and in good time.
4. Issue Certificate of Conformity Once satisfactory evidence has been provided, you will be entered as ‘Assured’ on the Scheme Member Checker database and you can then sell your product(s) as ‘Assured’. You may receive an actual certificate in electronic format or printed but the status on the Scheme Member Checker database is definit 5.
Renewal You will be invited to renew your membership annually, 12 months after the initial assessment and every 12 months thereafter. You will receive a renewal notice and a maximum of two reminder letters.
Routine Assessments and Spot Checks 6.
An assessor will make regular visits (or carry out remote assessments) similar to your initial assessment to check you are continuing to conform to the Standards at all times. These assessments will normally be once per membership year with the exception of the RTA dairy and beef and lamb farm schemes which will be once every 18 months. You may also be subject to spot check visits, some of which may be unannounced as part of our risk based approach to inspections. If you do not conform to any Standards you must provide evidence, normally within 28 days, that you have rectified them as outlined at Steps 2 and 3 above. If y ou have a major non-conformance or excessive non-conformances against the Standards, your certificatio n may be suspended until you have shown you have put this right. (Assessment arrangements for meat and poultry processing, livestock transport, livestock markets and livestock collection centres are outlined in the online standards manual.) Suspension:
Your membership and certification can also be suspended if you have not put nonconformances right within the time stipulated or if an unannounced spot check as a result of our risk based approach to inspections shows no improvement and the member is still categorised as high risk. Suspension is only lifted once you have proved that you have corrected the non-conformances. In some cases, a re-visit may be required. You must not sell products as ‘Red Tractor Assured’ whilst your certification is suspended.
Withdrawal:
If within 3 months of the suspension date you have not demonstrated that you have corrected the non-conformances, the Certification Body will withdraw certification and your membership will automatically terminate. The Certification Body will also withdraw certification and your membership will automatically terminate if you are still categorised as high risk following two consecutive unannounced spot checks as a result of our risk based approach to inspections. You can only regain certification by following the procedure for a new applicant and as long as no other sanctions or non-conformances remain. Your right to sell products as ‘Red Tractor Assured’ will cease immediately if your certification is withdrawn or if your membership is terminated for any other reason or expires and is not renewed within one month of expiry in accordance with the membership rules.
