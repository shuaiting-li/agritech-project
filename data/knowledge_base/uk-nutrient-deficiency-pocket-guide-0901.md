3 Introduction Crop nutrition There are 13 mineral nutrients which are essential for plant growth. These are termed "essential" because without any one of these, plants will simply fail to grow. Together with non-mineral nutrients carbon, hydrogen and oxygen these form the basis of all plant production upon which the world‘s population ultimately relies upon for food. Great advances in plant breeding have given our modern crop plants a huge genetic potential for high yields and improved quality but it must never be overlooked that plants must be sufficiently supplied with nutrient to achieve this potential; after all, the adage "you are what you eat" applies equally to plants as it does to animals.


---
4 Nutrient deficiency in crops If one or more nutrients is in short supply, this nutrient then becomes the limiting factor for the success of the crop and no amount of additional inputs will improve the yield unless the limiting nutrient is addressed. This simple "law of limiting factors" is described clearly in Liebigs’ barrel analogy below. By learning how to correctly identify deficiencies in crops, remedial action can be taken to mitigate the effects and perhaps more importantly, preventative action can be taken in the future to try to ensure that crops in similar situations are not undersupplied again.


---
5 The importance of a "balanced approach" The central concept of any crop nutrition program should follow that of a balanced approach. Nitrogen is the key driver of outright yield for most crops but the supporting nutrients, in particular potash, sulphur and magnesium are equally as important to provide a fertile soil in which the response to N fertiliser can be maximised, and costly losses to the environment minimised. Secondary nutrients are only termed thus due to the fact that they are required in slightly smaller quantities than N, P or K, they are not secondary in importance to the crop. Similarly micronutrients, or trace elements are only required in tiny quantities but the effect of deficiency can be devastating. A balanced approach therefore provides additional nutrients which may be limiting the response of the NPK fertiliser applied.


---
6 Prevention is key This book attempts to describe how to identify acute deficiency symptoms and provides some advice on how best to treat such deficiency. It should be stressed with great importance however that the best crop management practice would avoid deficiency occurring in the first place. By the time deficiency has been noted in the field, the crop has already suffered a high degree of stress and under such conditions, productivity has usually been compromised. By providing advice on risk factors and situations where deficiency is likely, a program of preventative action can be put in place.

7 Section 2 – How to use this book How to use this guide 1. First look up the crop in question from the main index.
2. Check the pictures in section 4 and descriptions to check if there are some similarities with your field observations.
3. After identifying a potential deficiency, go to section 3 and read the relevant section on the nutrient for general information and advice on risk factors and deficiency prevention.
4. After you are satisfied you have correctly identified a deficiency, go to section 5 for advice and product recommendations to help to alleviate the acute effects of deficiency in your crop.
Please note that this book provides a visual guide only and individual symptoms in crops can vary significantly.
It is therefore recommended that deficiency in crops is always verified by foliar analysis.

8 Section 3 – Nutrients Nitrogen (N) Nitrogen supply is possibly the single most important factor in determining the yield of a crop. N in soils can be measured by deep profile soil analysis, "N sensor" type systems and more typically by some standard evaluations of soil N supply based on number of factors such as soil type, winter rainfall, previous cropping etc.
High risk situations:
Sandy soils, low organic matter, high winter rainfall, milling wheat.
Prevention:
Accurate assessment of soil N supply followed with a robust fertiliser program well timed prior to the onset of the main growth period. Provision of an adequate supply of all other nutrients particularly S, K and Mg is crucial.
Deficiency:
Tends to be stunted plants and chlorosis on older leaves first (cf. S deficiency on younger leaves).


---
9 Treatment:
apply liquid N product to treat acute deficiency (eg. Urea, UAN).
Phosphorus (P) Phosphorus is particularly important at early growth stages to get a good start and for strong rooting. P supply is also crucial for managing energy within the plant. Evaluation is by soil analysis.
High risk situations:
Heavier soils, acid soils, high pH soils, early growth stages with limited root structure.
Prevention:
Maintenance of soil target index 2 for arable and 3 for horticultural crops. Soil should be tested every 3-4 years to monitor phosphate levels.
Deficiency:
Typically reddening of stems, stunted growth and poor rooting.


---
10 Treatment:
Difficult to treat curatively, some foliar fertilisers containing P may help (eg.
Potassium phosphite) but prevention by ensuring adequate soil P is fundamental.
Potassium (K) Potash is required by most crops in greater quantities than N or P and the chief functions are water management, resistance to stress and plant strength.
Adequate K is also vital for efficient N use.
Evaluation in soil analysis is generally satisfactory although care should be taken to also check for excessive Ca, Mg or Na which can mask the availability of K.
High risk situations:
Sandy and organic soils, high soil levels of magnesium or calcium, K fixing soils.
Prevention:
Maintenance of soil index 2- for arable and 2+ for potatoes and horticultural crops. Soils should be tested every 3-4 years to monitor potash levels.


---
11 Deficiency:
Typically necrosis of leaf tips and margins beginning on older leaves. Susceptibility to drought, lodging and plant pathogens is also increased.
Treatment:
Foliar K applications (eg. SOLUMOP or HORTISUL) are effective at providing K during peak demand and to alleviate temporary deficiency but are not a substitute for ensuring adequate soil K for field grown crops.
Magnesium (Mg) Magnesium is present in chlorophyll which is the key for photosynthesis and is responsible for activating more plant enzymes than any other plant nutrient.
Evaluation in soil analysis is generally satisfactory although care should be taken to also check for excessive K, Ca or Na which can mask the availability of Mg.
High risk situations:
High or low pH, high potash or calcium soil levels, sandy soils, poor root architecture.


---
12 Prevention:
Maintenance of adequate Mg levels in soils by replacing nutrient offtake, avoid over-liming. Use only water-soluble Mg sources such as ESTA Kieserite.
Deficiency:
Typically interveinal chlorosis giving a marbled effect in broad-leaved crops and a speckling in cereals. Always appears first on older leaves and eventually leads to leaf fall.
Treatment:
Foliar Mg applications using Bittersalz (eg. EPSO Top, EPSO Microtop, EPSO Combitop) are highly effective at providing Mg during peak demand and to alleviate temporary deficiency but are not a substitute for adequate soil Mg.


---
13 Sulphur (S) Sulphur is a vital component of some essential plant proteins and therefore is particularly important for protein crops, milling wheat and also for oilseeds.
Evaluation can be done by deep profile soil analysis although malate/sulphate foliage test has now become the industry standard.
High risk situations:
Sandy soils, low organic matter, high winter rainfall, milling wheat, rural areas.
Prevention:
Ensure full S demand is met through timely applications of water soluble sulphur in fertilisers and/or manures.
Deficiency:
Usually apparent as yellowing on younger leaves first (cf. N deficiency appearing first on older leaves).
Treatment:
Foliar applications of EPSO products effectively boost sulphur in crops and can help in alleviating temporary demand / deficiency.


---
14 Manganese (Mn) Trace element important for enzyme activation, N use and energy cycle. Mn deficiency is widespread in the UK and Ireland. Foliar analysis is most reliable.
High risk situations:
Loose, puffy seedbeds. Organic soils and high pH.
Prevention:
Rolling seedbeds, regular foliar Mn applications on high risk fields, avoid over-liming.
Deficiency:
Typically speckling and mottled appearance of leaves which develops into necrosis.
Treatment:
Foliar applications of EPSO Combitop or EPSO Microtop rapidly correct Mn deficiency.


---
15 Boron (B) Trace element vital for flowering, cell membranes and cell division. Oilseeds and roots have high requirement.
Evaluation in soil analysis is generally satisfactory.
High risk situations:
Sandy soils, high pH, dry conditions.
Prevention:
Use of fertilisers containing Boron to boost soil B together with preventative treatment with EPSO Microtop applied regularly to the crop.
Deficiency:
Typically death of growing points, rotting and hollowing of roots, misshapen leaves.
Treatment:
Foliar application of EPSO Microtop.


---
16 Zinc (Zn) Increasing in importance in the UK and Ireland, Zinc is important for seed production, root growth and disease resistance.
High risk situations:
High pH, sandy and shale soils, high Mg, K or Ca soils levels.
Prevention:
Routine preventative applications of EPSO Combitop.
Deficiency:
Tends to be stunted plants and chlorosis on older leaves first (cf. S deficiency on younger leaves).
Treatment:
Foliar application of EPSO Combitop.

---
19 ycneicfied muissatoP slaereC Potassium deficiency (K) Necrosis of leaf margins and especially leaf tips. Plants become easily desiccated and are markedly more susceptible to lodging.
Treatment:
K deficiency is difficult to treat curatively and emphasis should be ensuring adequate soil K is available.
Some foliar K products can help to alleviate temporary peak demand and/or deficiency.


---
20 Cereals


---
21 ycneicfied negortiN slaereC Nitrogen deficiency (N) General yellow/orange tinting of entire leaves beginning on older leaves first.

Treatment:
Foliar applications of liquid N fertilisers (eg. UAN).


---
22 Cereals


---
23 ycneicfied surohpsohP slaereC Phosphorus deficiency (P) Shades of red or purple at the base of cereals together with thin leaves and stunted plants are classic signs of P deficiency. Symptoms tend to show very early on and plants with poor root structure are affected most severely.
Treatment:
P deficiency is difficult to treat curatively and emphasis should be ensuring adequate soil P is available. Foliar application of Potassium phosphite may help to alleviate temporary demand.


---
24 Cereals


---
25 ycneicfied muisengaM slaereC Magnesium deficiency (Mg) Chlorotic speckling on older leaves first later becoming necrotic. Often seen when plants stressed through cold, dry conditions or when rooting is poor.

33 ycneicfied muissatoP epar deesliO Potassium deficiency (K) Purpling and later necrosis of leaf margins in particular. Plants are more susceptible to lodging and tend to senesce earlier.
Treatment:
K deficiency is difficult to treat curatively and the emphasis should be on achieving and maintaining an adequate supply from the soil.
Note that although K removal is quite modest at around 40-50 kg K O/ha, the 2 crop takes up over 200kg/ha and this must be accounted for.


---
34 Oilseed rape nroZ .W .rD :sotohP


---
35 ycneicfied negortiN epar deesliO Nitrogen deficiency (N) General yellow/orange tinting of entire leaves beginning on older leaves first in the early spring. Leaf number is reduced and plants are stunted. Later, pods in particular are small.

---
36 Oilseed rape


---
37 ycneicfied surohpsohP epar deesliO Phosphorus deficiency (P) Shades of red or purple at the base of plants together with stunting are classic signs of P deficiency. Symptoms tend to show very early on and plants with poor root structure resulting from min-till techniques or soil consolidation are affected most severely.
Treatment:
If detected early enough, water-soluble P fertiliser can be applied post-emergence although maintenance of adequate soil reserves is more satisfactory.


---
38 Oilseed rape


---
39 ycneicfied muisengaM epar deesliO Magnesium deficiency (Mg) Interveinal chlorosis on older lower leaves with a marbling effect (leaf veins remain green). Later, total whitening of leaves followed by leaf fall. Modern high yielding cultivars appear to have an increasing Mg requirement.

---
44 Maize -K


---
45 ycneicfied muissatoP eziaM Potassium deficiency (K) Flaccid leaves with mild chlorosis on leaf margins. Later distortion of leaves and spreading necrosis from margins inwards (cf.). Older leaves are affected first.
Treatment:
Emphasis should be on achieving and maintaining adequate soil K although foliar application of HORTISUL can effectively provide additional K for peak demand and/or deficiency.


---
46 Maize


---
47 ycneicfied surohpsohP eziaM Phosphorus deficiency (P) Stunted dark leaves with purple/red tinge and especially purpling of the stem base from a very early stage indicates P deficiency. Symptoms can also be induced in cold weather.
Treatment:
If detected early enough, water-soluble P fertiliser can be placed post-emergence.


---
48 Maize


---
49 ycneicfied muisengaM eziaM Magnesium deficiency (Mg) Typical early symptoms of magnesium deficiency include chlorosis between the leaf veins which is rather diffuse (cf. Zinc deficiency where the stripes are more defined). This occurs first on older leaves and later the whole plant is affected with leaf curling, severe chorosis/necrosis starting at the leaf tips and eventually leaf death.
Treatment:
Foliar application of EPSO Top, EPSO Microtop or EPSO Combitop – see section 5 for details.


---
50 Maize


---
51 ycneicfied cniZ eziaM Zinc deficiency (Zn) Symptoms of zinc deficiency in maize appear as a distinct yellow striping of the leaves. Areas of leaf near the stalk may develop a general white to yellow discolouration (‘whitebud’).
In cases of severe deficiency, the plants are stunted due to shortened internodes and the lower leaves show a reddish or yellowish streak about one third of the way from the leaf margin.
Treatment:
Foliar application of EPSO Combitop – see section 5 for details.


---
52 Peas / Beans


---
53 ycneicfied muissatoP snaeB / saeP Potassium deficiency (K) Serious potassium deficiency causes yellowing or scorching of leaf margins, inward curling of leaves and, in beans, shortening of internodes. The N fixing ability of legumes deficient in K is also compromised and therefore N deficiency symptoms may also be indicative of K deficiency.
Treatment:
Emphasis should be on achieving and maintaining adequate soil K.


---
54 Peas / Beans


---
55 ycneicfied muisengaM snaeB / saeP Magnesium deficiency (Mg) Typical early symptoms of magnesium deficiency in peas include diffuse chlorosis on the middle of the older leaves together with some pinkish speckling and leaves which curl inwards.
In beans there is a wide array of symptoms that cover leaves of all ages, after an initial stunting of growth.
A very early symptom is a rolling in of the youngest leaves, followed by an umbrella-like folding back of the leaflets, and the appearance of a mottled chlorosis.
Treatment:
Foliar applications of EPSO products effectively treat Mg deficiency – (see section 5) but are not a complete substitute for providing adequate soil Mg through applications of ESTA Kieserite.


---
56 Potatoes


---
57 ycneicfied muissatoP seotatoP Potassium deficiency (K) Bronzing of leaves and necrosis of leaf margins and tips. Stunted bushy plants with small leaves and very premature senescence before adequate tuber bulking. Increased black spot in tubers also indicates K deficiency.
Treatment:
Emphasis should be on providing adequate reserves of soil K (index 2+) although a foliar application of Potassium sulphate (HORTISUL) can effectively boost K and is particularly useful for crops in very light soils.


---
58 Potatoes -Mg +Mg


---
59 ycneicfied muisengaM seotatoP Magnesium deficiency (Mg) Interveinal chlorosis on older lower leaves with a marbling effect (leaf veins remain green). Later various shades of red/purple can appear as chlorophyll breaks down leading eventually to leaf necrosis. Yield effect on determinate cultivars may be more severe.
Treatment:
Foliar application of EPSO Top, EPSO Microtop or EPSO Combitop – see section 5 for details.
Use of soil fertilisers containing ESTA® Kieserite is a very effective way of ensuring that deficiency is prevented.


---
60 Sugar beet


---
61 ycneicfied muissatoP teeb raguS Potassium deficiency (K) Dull leaves with mild chlorosis on leaf margins. Later distortion of leaves and spreading necrosis from margins inwards.
Older leaves are affected first.
Treatment:
Emphasis should be on providing and maintaining adequate soil K (index 2) for maximum yield.


---
62 Sugar beet


---
63 ycneicfied negortiN teeb raguS Nitrogen deficiency (N) Older leaves first turn pale yellow and die with new leaves becoming thinner and longer. Plants often show erect growth habit and fail to attain adequate yield.
Treatment:
Applications of N in a semi-mature crop are not recommended for quality reasons. Total N requirement should be applied by the established seedling stage.


---

69 ycneicfied noroB teeb raguS Boron deficiency (B) Death of growing points in centre of plant, brown fibrous patches on leaf stems, severe diffuse leaf yellowing often very patchy in field. Root often brown/ black at top with corky growth.
Treatment:
Foliar application of EPSO Microtop – see section 5 for details.


---
70 Sugar beet


---
71 ycneicfied esenagnaM teeb raguS Manganese deficiency (Mn) Patchy chlorotic areas first appear early in Spring which later become speckled hence the term "speckled yellows". Leaves may curl inwards and take on an upright habit. Spots may become translucent and holes in leaves commonly form in severe cases.
