Introduction This guide is here to support you in making the best decisions on varieties specific to your requirement, by giving you a snap shot of what we have to offer.
Welcome to the 2025 edition of the It is becoming increasingly important to ADM Agriculture Maize Seed Guide ensure maximum crop production is achieved when growing maize crops, therefore we have also added some information on crop nutrition, SFI opportunities and undersowing.
We are working alongside a number of maize breeders within the UK to give you access to the best products on the market to fit within your business.

Drilling, Where and When?
The FAO number of a variety is its relative index of maturity. A variety with a lower FAO number will require less heat units to reach harvest time unlike a variety with a higher FAO number which will need more heat units to reach harvest time.
Location can greatly differ how long varieties take to reach harvest, the same variety drilled in the North and the South will not mature at the same time due to the heat unit variation.
When is the best time to drill? This depends on soil temperature and conditions, plus the seedbed moisture. Usually it is suggested to drill when soils are 8 degrees and rising for at least 3-4 days. If you drill too early there is a risk of germination issues and drilling too late can increase the risk of lodging plus delaying harvest.
Selecting Varieties Choosing the right variety for you and your land is important, with the first consideration being what the maize is being grown for i.e. grain, forage or biogas, where in the UK you are based - is this a warmer location and is the land heavy or light. It is also worth noting when you want to be harvesting the crop - a later maturing variety on heavy areas may increase your risk of not being able to work the land when it reaches its optimum harvest potential.

Advantages of Growing Maize Maize offers a range of benefits to those growing it. It has high yield potential and versatility to grow in a range of different climates, due to a number of varieties available on the market. Growing maize can offer cost saving for the grower, in comparison to other crops, with the ability to use minimal tillage, alongside environmental benefits like the reduction for spray usage.
Feed Biogas (AD) Grain Maize offers high levels of starch, The growing of maize for AD Grain maize is typically harvested energy and other intake plants has grown in popularity, three to five weeks after forage characteristics that allow for a due to Renewable heat incentive maize, allowing the grain to dry higher dry matter yield potential schemes which have grown out before being harvested for ruminant animals. Varieties largely in the UK. As AD plants through a maize combine headercan also be selected on their cell require high output feed stock, as apposed to a forager. When wall digestibility, ME yield and maize fits well into this category, picking grain maize it is therefore starch yield, which are also very with high dry matter yield essential to look at early maturing useful metrics when planning potential and low cost per tonne varieties as well as grain yield and ruminant diets. Furthermore, to grow, compared with standing ability, due to longer maize offer a sustainable food alternative feed stock options. periods in the field.

Crop Nutrition Physiostart | Microgranular Starter Fertiliser Optimising Maize Establishment and Maximising Yield Top up Your Maize Nutrition ▪ Maize requires high phosphorus availability at emergence to drive root growth and early vigour.
▪ Standard fertiliser applications often result in nutrient lock-up, limiting plant uptake.
▪ Physiostart provides highly available phosphorus, nitrogen, sulphur, and zinc directly to the seed, ensuring rapid absorption at the most critical stage.
▪ PhysioPro biostimulant technology improves root formation, maximising nutrient efficiency and early plant development.
What is Physiostart? Why Apply Physiostart?
Physiostart is a microgranular starter fertiliser, delivering essential nutrients in a highly available Physiostart provides maize with an efficient nutrient form at sowing. Its precision application at seed delivery system, ensuring strong establishment and placement ensures maize plants receive the right higher yields.

Undersowing Maize Please talk to us about the best undersowing product to fit your requirements, we have a large variety of grass mixes and cover crops available.
Undersowing maize can offer a number of benefits to the crop. Firstly, if undersown with a grass, like an Italian Ryegrass, this will provide nitrogen retention and soil retention, especially in fields that may be on a gradual slope for example. This also means once the maize has been harvested, the soil is not left bare and reduces the risk of leaching, which has environmental benefits. The grass sward base can also provide better travelling opportunities when foraging the crop in more testing weather seasons.
Undersowing, should in most cases be done in early June, giving the grass a good chance to establish quickly, but also allowing the maize plant to make the 4-5 leaf stage, without competition. There are a couple Depending on crop rotation, there will be the of different way this can be executed, some will opportunity to graze the under sown crop with broadcast grass seed on to the maize crop, which is the livestock. If you will be winter cropping, there will be cheapest options, but generally leaves lesser results, substantially more organic matter to incorporate back due to limited seed to soil contact. Many are now into the soil. This is also an opportunity with SFI to gain using specialist drills, designed speciality for the companion cropping payment of £55/ha on CIPM3.
