b) following the month of clearance of the seed. The grower shall be liable for the levy arising under the AHDB Direct Levy Scheme, applicable at the date of removal of the goods from the Grower’s farm. If the contract is priced at a premium over the applicable UK average AHDB price for the week of clearance of the goods, it shall be the ex-farm feed price for the contract category published.
c) Movement of part of the crop will not constitute any commitment by the Merchant to clear the whole crop at the agreed price.
d) The Grower will be liable for any new or modified levy introduced by any statutory body prior to the date of removal of the goods.
4. PREVIOUS CROPPING a) The Grower shall sow, with equipment which has been thoroughly cleaned before use, all the stock seed supplied by ADM Agriculture on clean land that in the two years prior to sowing that seed has been cropped in accordance with the Regulations and/or Guidelines then in force.
b) To produce certified First-Generation seed, the land must not have been used to grow any other cereal species or any other varieties of the same species in the two preceding years. If the same variety had been grown in both the two years prior to planting the crop grown must have been sown only with Pre-Basic, Basic, Certified or other authenticated seed, and such cropping must be substantiated by the Grower.
c) To produce certified Second-Generation seed, the land must not have been used to grow any other cereal species in the previous year and, where possible, at least two years’ break is desirable. The land must not have been used to grow any other variety of the same species in the two preceding years. If the same variety was grown in either of those preceding years such crops must have been sown with, Pre-Basic, Basic, Certified or other authenticated seed, and such cropping must be substantiated by the Grower.
5. CROP FAILURE i. The Grower shall promptly report to ADM Agriculture any instances of crop failure, whether partial or otherwise, which will be promptly confirmed in writing.
ii. The Grower shall not plough up or otherwise destroy the crop or any part of it without the prior written agreement of ADM Agriculture.

ii. Loose Smut in wheat or barley. Where a seed crop is grown adjacent to a crop of the same species, which is heavily contaminated with Loose Smut, ADM Agriculture shall have the option of undertaking an embryo test. If the level of Loose Smut is shown to be greater than the standard laid down in the Regulations and/or Guidelines currently in force, ADM Agriculture shall have the right, at their absolute discretion, to reject the crop.
7. RETENTION OF SEED LABELS The Grower shall retain in an envelope marked with the field name and O.S. number/s all labels from

each stock of seed sown from that supplied by ADM Agriculture. The envelope and its contents shall be shown to the Field Inspector on request. Two further labels shall be returned to the offices of ADM Agriculture with the cropping details.
8. GROWTH REGULATORS AND OTHER CHEMICALS Before using any chemicals on the growing crop, or on the harvested grain, which might jeopardize approval and certification, the grower shall seek the approval of ADM Agriculture. ADM Agriculture shall reply in writing. Providing the application of such chemicals is approved under the Agricultural Chemicals Approval Scheme the Grower shall strictly observe the manufacturers’ instructions. If there is no suggestion that any chemical might have a deleterious effect on the seed crop such permission shall not be unreasonably withheld by ADM Agriculture. The use of any chemicals is strictly at The Growers’ risk and any distortion of the growing crop may result in rejection for certification by ADM Agriculture.
9. FIELD INSPECTION a) If on field inspection the crop fails to meet the quality for certification, the contract may, at the discretion of ADM Agriculture, be terminated.
b) During the period of growth, the weed seeds listed in Clause 13 (d) herein, or any weeds listed in the Plant Varieties and Seeds Act 1964 and Plant Varieties Act 1997 (or any amendments thereof) as obnoxious weeds, or Ergot Sclerotia, shall not be found in the crop in a quantity which ADM Agriculture – at their discretion and whose decision shall be final - shall consider will cause the crop to be unsuitable for seed purposes.

c) The Grower shall ensure that:
i. The storage and/or transportation facilities of the crop are thoroughly cleaned before use.
ii. They shall be clearly labelled with the variety and species of the grain content and the O.S.
numbers of the fields from which the grain was harvested.

iv. The Grower shall ensure that seed shall not at any stage come into contact, either directly or indirectly, with any substance or material of whatever nature, especially growth suppressant which may have a damaging effect on the seed and its ability to germinate, or on the subsequent crop grown from the seed.
v. Crops of the same variety shall not be bulked together without prior authority from ADM Agriculture.

vi. If the Grower fails to dry or condition their contract crop by 31 August for autumn sowing seed or by 31 October for spring sowing seed to the standard required in clause 13 herein, so ADM Agriculture is prevented from marketing the produce for seed purposes, ADM Agriculture shall have the right, at their absolute discretion, to reject the produce of the contracted crop.
11. SAMPLING a) Before delivery of the seed crop to ADM Agriculture the Grower shall submit a 3kg.
representative sample of the seed. The final date of receipt of such samples shall be 30 September for autumn sowing seed and 31 October for spring sowing seed.
b) ADM Agriculture shall, at their cost, test, or have the sample tested to determine the moisture content (dry matter basis), varietal purity, germination energy or capacity (as appropriate) and Loose Smut infection.
c) If the test results show that the seed does not meet the contractual standards then ADM Agriculture shall by 31 December for an autumn sowing variety or by 30 March for a spring sown variety, advise the Grower in writing of their rejection of the seed.

standard.
f) The produce shall be dry, clean, well matured and in marketable condition for seed purposes and in this connection ‘dry’ shall mean not more than 15.0% moisture content, both on the farm and at the point of delivery (see Clause 14). It is a condition of the contract that the crop so delivered shall be of good colour, quality and appearance consistent with the season and in all respects fit for purpose.
f) Where the crop is barley, a test for Loose Smut may be carried out on approx. 1000 embryos, and if this exceeds 0.2% while the crop has achieved the required standard for Loose Smut in the field at the inspection stage, then ADM Agriculture has the right to reject the crop.

b) Reject the grain or c) Accept the grain with moisture above 15.0% and deduct a penalty of £1.00 per tonne for each 0.5% (or part thereof) moisture above 15%, to cover allowances incurred by the subsequent sale or disposal of the removed screenings.

i. The Grower shall submit to ADM Agriculture a 2kg sample of the bulk pursuant to Clause 11 hereof, ii. ADM Agriculture will pass a representative 100 grams of this sample over a 2.5mm slotted hole sieve and the quantity passing through this sieve will be weighed. This weight will then be expressed as a percentage of 100 grams.
i. If the screenings percentage exceeds the contractual limit, ADM Agriculture has the option to either (i) deduct £1.00 per tonne for each 0.5% or part thereof over the contractual limit or reject the crop for seed.
c) If cleaning out turns exceed 10% by weight, ADM Agriculture have the option to deduct £1.00 per 0.5% or part thereof above 10%.

In this situation no seed premiums will be payable on such balances.
g) The Grower shall be responsible for weighbridge charges on loads collected from their farm.
Should the Grower wish to weigh or check-weigh elsewhere then such costs will be to the Grower’s account.
