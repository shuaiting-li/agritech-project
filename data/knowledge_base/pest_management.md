# Pest Monitoring Guidelines

- Scout the field twice weekly during the rainy season.
- Release natural predators like lady beetles to control aphids.
- Use neem oil (3%) spray during early morning or late evening to avoid leaf burn.
- Rotate biological and chemical treatments to delay resistance.
- Record infestation hotspots using GPS markers for follow-up visits.
