Introduction This guide aims to support understanding and enhancement of wheat production through improved management.
The steps in any cycle of management are to:
Set targets Monitor Assess success progress Adjust inputs Measurements are vital to good management and for learning. As well as assessing weeds, pests and diseases, crop managers must assess the crop itself. Crop progress, structure and final performance can then be compared with benchmarks or new targets.
A crop’s growth best relates to the natural resources it captures. By knowing available resources, managers can tell whether better or worse than expected growth is due to weather or husbandry.
Crop assessments should be objective and, where possible, measured. This guide presents metrics by which production targets can be set and crop progress monitored. It also explains how the metrics interrelate and can be influenced.

Capturing natural resources Figure 1. Summarises the capture and utilisation of natural resources, particularly solar energy, water and carbon dioxide in wheat. It illustrates how these resources convert into grain and non-grain energy (expressed here in t/ha biomass or grain). It also introduces the concept of ‘thermal time’, which represents the time taken for the crop to move from one growth stage to the next, based on the cumulative heat received Source: ADAS 4 raloS ygrene erutpac ygrenE %74 ssamoiB htworg htworg tooR tn e m p o le v e d p o rC 02 2 Above ground biomass (t/ha) 01 0 Rooting depth (m) 1 )s y a d C º( e m it la m re h T 000,3 000,2 000,1 retaw lios etatcid htped dna erutxet lioS a rof m/mm 051 .g.e( yticapac gnidloh )kcor revo ton ,epyt lios muidem r a e y / a h / J T 5 3 :y g r e n e r a lo S lioS mm 051 erutpac retaw niar remmus sulp latot mm 053 = erutpac retaw

Managing wheat yields Yield determination Crops harvest energy – they convert natural resources (solar energy, carbon dioxide and water) into edible and other forms of energy. Water is required in proportion to the energy captured.
Cereal yields depend on the following: Growth after flowering • Available natural resources • Their capture • Their conversion to harvestable grain Figure 2. Crop biomass distribution in wheat (%) Source: ADAS In the UK, light limitation of wheat yields is more common Resource capture and conversion than water limitation. Water limitation becomes more common as yields increase. Rates of energy absorption, carbon dioxide fixation and water transpiration by leaf canopies (Figure 3) are Available natural resources cannot generally be controlled, inherently linked, so light use, water use and biomass so yields must be managed primarily through influencing formation are roughly proportional.
their capture.
Light capture depends mainly on green canopy longevity.
Each five extra days of full light capture by a green canopy should be associated with 1 t/ha of extra crop growth.
Water capture depends mainly on rooting depth. On a soil holding 15% available water, an increase in rooting depth of 14 cm should provide an extra 20 mm of water, which should support one extra t/ha of biomass growth.
The Harvest Index is the proportion of total crop biomass growth that is harvested as grain. The benchmark is 51% at harvest (Figure 2).
Grain biomass arises from all growth after flowering plus some biomass (proteins and sugars) transferred from the straw.
The Harvest Index is thought to be influenced more by variety choice than by husbandry.

What are benchmarks?
< 100 100–200 200–300 This symbol identifies a benchmark – a quantitative 300–400 reference point against which a crop’s performance 400–500 can be compared. By assessing crops against 500–600 benchmark values, growers can determine how 600–700 best to manipulate husbandry. Some targets and husbandry responses are suggested, but this guide > 700 is not an agronomy manual.
At-a-glance benchmark values are provided at the back of this guide.
Each benchmark is based on observations of a high-yielding feed wheat with a slow rate of development at UK sites through several seasons.
Unless otherwise stated, crops were sown in early October at 375 seeds/m2 and grown with ample nutrition, complete crop protection and without lodging.
Some graphs to illustrate growth processes are based on example crops and may give data that differs from benchmarks. The AHDB Figure 6b. Average summer rainfall April–July, 1981–2010 (mm) Recommended Lists (RL) includes some benchmark Source: ADAS data for modern varieties: ahdb.org.uk/rl Varietal influence Benchmarks vary in the extent to which they are affected by genetics (heritability). Benchmarks with 15 high heritability are strongly influenced by choice of 16 variety, whereas benchmarks with low heritability are principally controlled by husbandry choices.
17 18 The heritability of each benchmark is indicated as 19 high, medium or low and the other management choices with a significant effect are listed.

Crop life cycle Throughout the growing season, a crop changes in form Implications for management (development) and accumulates dry matter (growth).
Varieties vary in their response to vernalisation and day length. The relative speed of development of varieties Key facts to reach GS31 from early, medium and late sowings is published in the AHDB Recommended Lists. Conservative Development times for the latest safe sowing date to allow sufficient • Governed by temperature and day length vernalisation to trigger flowering are also published.
• Not easily managed during the season Prolonging any development phase increases dry matter formation during that phase.
Varietal influence: High Other influences: Sowing date • Prolong development by sowing slow-developing varieties early Growth • Management after sowing influences growth, • Can be managed using interventions through not development the season • For highest yields, feed and protect leaves that Varietal influence: Medium emerge during stem extension in preference to Other influences: Nutrition, crop protection earlier, lower leaves products, growth regulators • T1 sprays should be timed to protect final leaf 3.
Spraying early will be ineffective, as the leaf will be within the leaf sheath The key development phases Cereal growth stages are published near the back of this Key management action timings guide. The key growth stages – crop emergence (GS10), Key periods and specific timings for key nutrition and the start of stem extension (GS31), flowering (GS61) crop protection products are shown in Figure 7.
and the end of grain filling (GS87) – separate the key development phases: ‘foundation’, ‘construction’ and These timings are indicative of what may be applied 'production', as explained in Figure 7. to a typical wheat crop and are not intended as recommendations.
The duration of each phase is governed by:

consulted for specific rate and timing recommendations.
Vernalisation: A period of cool temperatures (0–12ºC) advances floral development and reduces the duration of the foundation phase. The majority of winter wheat varieties respond strongly to vernalisation, and spring wheats may have a slight response.
Day length: Long days advance floral development in most varieties. Day length affects the duration of both foundation and construction phases. Almost all commercial UK wheat varieties respond to day length.
Stress-sensitive stages The apex is frost-tolerant until reproductive development starts. Susceptibility to frost damage is highest when the ear is developing. Frost risk falls significantly from April. Overall risk of damage is lowest in late May and early June. From July onwards, drought risk increases.

For overwinter survival, count the plant population (as per the method above) after winter but before significant warming and growth occurs. At this stage, it can be hard to differentiate between plants and tillers, hence plants may need to be dug up to determine actual numbers.

Leaf emergence slows or stops in winter and progressively speeds up as temperatures rise in spring.
Other environmental factors have little effect on leaf emergence.
The time period measured in thermal time (ºC days 50 above a base temperature of 0ºC) between the emergence of two successive leaves is called the phyllochron. It varies with variety and sowing date. Late 40 sowing decreases both phyllochron and total leaves October drilling emerged – e.g. early September drilling may give 15 leaves, while November drilling may give nine leaves. 30 20 How to measure the phyllochron November drilling The phyllochron can be measured by tagging the 10 youngest, fully emerged leaf when plants have three fully emerged leaves, and again when they have seven fully emerged leaves.

Tillering patterns 1,020 shoots/m2 (8 April, GS30–31) Varietal influence: Low Other influences: Sowing date, plant population, nitrogen supply The timing of tillering depends on sowing date, plant numbers established and temperature.
• Early sowing (early September): Most tillering occurs in autumn. If more than 250 plants/m2 are established, then tillering usually ends before winter. If fewer than 100 plants/m2 are established, tillering can continue into spring • Late sowing (November): Tillering is usually delayed until spring unless unusually warm temperatures follow drilling Tillering normally ends when Green Area Index (GAI) reaches about 1. In dense crops, this usually occurs just before GS31. Limited resources, especially nitrogen, may limit tiller production.
The benchmark maximum for a late September to early October-sown crop with 260 plants/m2 is 1,020 shoots/m2.
The benchmark date of maximum shoot number is in early April. Early sown crops or crops with many plants/m2 tend to have greater maximum shoot numbers. Varieties with large leaves or that reach stem extension early tend to have lower maximum shoot numbers (Figure 11).

Varietal influence: Low Other influences: Sowing date, soil structure, take-all Roots begin to grow at germination, with three to six seminal roots emerging before the second leaf appears. These can grow deep and persist throughout the crop’s life.
The number of crown roots, which develop from the stem base, relates to leaf and tiller numbers. Once the main shoot has three to four leaves, crown roots appear with thickened upper regions to anchor the plant.

Water and nutrient uptake GS61 The relative distribution of roots down the soil profile GS87 changes little between GS31 and anthesis. Over 70% of root length is found in the top 30 cm.
High rates of uptake of less mobile nutrients, such as phosphorus (P), only occur when root length densities (RLDs) exceed 5 cm/cm3 of soil. Lower root length densities are adequate for potassium (K) uptake and GS31 about 1 cm/cm3 is needed for the take-up of most of the available water and water-soluble nutrients, such as nitrogen. Lower RLDs will take up less of the available water and nutrients, this is shown in Figure 13.
Maximising root growth in the subsoil significantly improves soil water supply to the crop.

Roots fully utilise water and nitrogen to about 40 cm depth at GS31 and to 70 cm depth by GS61 Source: ADAS Implications for management Some PGRs may help to increase rooting but the main ways root systems can be managed is indirectly, through improved soil structure and drainage.
Encouraging deep rooting will improve water and nutrient supplies for crop growth. Varietal differences in crown root spread and low plant number can help to maximise root anchorage strength. These differences contribute to the lodging resistance score on the Recommended Lists (specific data on root and stem lodging may be available from breeders).
• Sow early to increase overall root system size at flowering Soil structure has a major impact on root growth and distribution. In some clay-rich soils, moisture extraction by roots promotes cracking, which improves soil structure and root access in following seasons. Hence, deep rooting can be self-sustaining, unless wheelings or cultivations destroy soil structure. With minimal tillage, enhanced earthworm activity creates long continuous pores in the subsoil to aid root penetration.
• Consider field drainage and soil management to ensure adequate pore spaces for aeration and root penetration into the subsoil. For further details, see the Field drainage guide • Take-all reduces rooting at all depths 17 )mc( htped lioS Root length density (cm/cm3 soil) How to measure rooting The established method for measuring root length GS31 involves taking soil cores, washing the soil from the roots and using a scanner to measure the roots. GS61 This method is time-consuming and requires specialist equipment.
An early visual assessment of rooting can be made by digging up representative plants with a spade within a couple of months of planting, measuring rooting depth with a ruler and weighing the washed roots to obtain root biomass. If a soil core is available, soil can be extracted to 90 cm in the spring and before harvest to assess changes in soil moisture as a proxy for rooting depth. Sampling from representative areas of the field is important, either based on soil type or crop growth.
Alternatively, soil structure can be assessed as a proxy for rooting, as good soil structure will allow the roots to penetrate to depth more easily and capture available water. 1 cm root/cm3 5 cm roots/cm3 Fully effective Fully effective The Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure (VESS – for uptake of for uptake of phosphorus details available at ahdb.org.uk/vess) involves soil water and nitrogen removal (to 30 cm depth), assessment and scoring, and can be carried out at any time of year (but preferably when the soil is moist).

Thus, it very variable. is possible to control canopy size by controlling nitrogen availability.
Seed contributes about 5 kg nitrogen/ha, while 20–40 kg/ha comes from the atmosphere, in rain and nitrogen-containing gases. However, most is acquired Table 2. Effect of nitrogen uptake on plant growth and development from soil. The benchmark is 75 kg/ha available nitrogen (nitrate and ammonium) at soil nitrogen supply (SNS) Index 1. In the UK, more than 50% of soils are Index 1 or above as shown in Figure 14.
Soil nitrogen availability is increased by unrecovered fertiliser from previous crops or organic residues, e.g.
legume roots or animal manures.
Soil nitrogen release is stimulated in warm, moist soils and after cultivations that thoroughly disturb the soil.
Nitrogen from a previous crop is released in autumn, before sowing to a greater (e.g. OSR, peas) or lesser (e.g. beans) extent depending on the crop.
Crop residues with low nitrogen such as straw can cause temporary unavailability through ‘locking up’ nitrogen, but some nitrogen is still released after a previous cereal crop through re-mineralisation of previously immobilised fertiliser nitrogen.
Uptake of soil nitrogen continues throughout growth.
Early sowing and unimpeded rooting improve soil nitrogen uptake.

Variation in soil nitrogen supply in UK arable fields - 40% from the first half of nitrogen applied Source: ADAS - 10% from the second half of nitrogen applied • Fertiliser nitrogen controls canopy size, primarily through shoot number • Nitrogen uptake is closely linked to canopy expansion • During grain filling, a large proportion of nitrogen in leaves and stems is redistributed to grain How to measure soil nitrogen Soil nitrogen supply can be estimated by a field assessment method (FAM) described in the Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) or, if the soil nitrogen level is potentially high (>120 kg nitrogen/ha) or is uncertain, by a soil mineral nitrogen (SMN) measurement. SMN is often measured to a depth of 90 cm in the spring (before any nitrogen is applied).

Pattern of nitrogen uptake degraded and nitrogen is transferred to form grain protein. This, not root uptake during grain filling, is the 81 kg/ha from sowing to first node (GS31) main source of grain nitrogen. At harvest, chaff, straw 167 kg/ha from first node to flowering and stubble contain 90 kg nitrogen/ha, that is 158 kg/ha less than at flowering.

By harvest, a typical crop takes up 279 kg/ha (Figure 15):

For each quadrat, cut the plants at ground level, dry them and weigh them, then send a subsample to a lab for grinding and percentage nitrogen determination.
To determine the total amount of nitrogen on an area basis, the percentage nitrogen in the crop needs to be multiplied by total dry weight of the crop. To determine the nitrogen redistribution to the grain, this assessment needs to be done just before harvest, the grain separated from the straw or chaff and percentage nitrogen measured for both samples.

Implications for management Where soil nitrogen residues may be large (>120 kg nitrogen/ha) or are uncertain, SMN analysis is a better predictor of available soil nitrogen than the field assessment method. It should include an estimate of crop nitrogen content at the time of soil sampling.
• Obtain a good estimate of eventual soil nitrogen supply by estimation or soil analysis Early spring nitrogen is important for some crops.
• Apply early nitrogen to encourage tillering after poor establishment or to overcome root restrictions, where there is soil compaction or a risk of take-all Late-spring nitrogen after tillering is needed by most crops. It encourages rapid canopy expansion, mainly through better tiller survival.
• Use late-spring nitrogen before the canopy turns pale, unless canopy size is excessive Early summer nitrogen around GS39 helps optimise canopy expansion and survival during grain filling.
• Use early summer nitrogen, particularly for crops with pale, small canopies or with high yield potential Late-summer nitrogen ensures canopy survival through grain filling as well as adequate grain protein concentration for breadmaking.
• Consider late nitrogen (summer-applied urea), particularly for crops intended for breadmaking, where yield potential is high and where field history indicates a need Access the AHDB Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) at ahdb.org.uk/rb209 20

Implications for management Achieving optimum canopy size is important for good yields. Eventual canopy size tends to be increased by pre-sowing management.
• Early sowing • High seed rate • Plentiful soil nitrogen • Adequate phosphorus and potassium, and correct pH During the growing season, canopy can be managed by:
• The amount and timing of fertiliser nitrogen applied • Disease control measures GAI 2.0 – GS31 Often, canopy growth needs to be kept in check to avoid exceeding target GAI.
How to measure GAI GAI can be measured in several ways. The simplest is to assess the green leaf area compared to the ground area by eye. A more accurate method involves cutting a known area of crop (e.g. 1 m2), removing the leaves and feeding them through a leaf area machine.
Some apps are now able to measure GAI from a photo taken vertically above the crop as shown in Figure 19. Multiple photos should be taken to get an average for a field. Apps are most accurate for growth stages up to early stem extension (around GS32). GAI 2.3 – GS31 Sensors (handheld, tractor-mounted, on drones or satellites) measure reflectance of different wavelengths of light. Various vegetation indices are then calculated, usually using near infrared or red wavelengths, which indicate crop cover.

Crop height increases rapidly during construction phase The extended stem Five internodes measuring 69 cm, excluding ear The extended stem Varietal influence: High Five internodes measuring 69 cm, not including ear Other influences: Sowing date, PGR use, nitrogen supply Varietal influence: High Other influences: Sowing date, PGR use, nitrogen supply Varieties and stem extension Height is highly dependent on variety. Varieties contain different combinations of dwarfing genes. In the AHDB Recommended Lists, height is measured to the top of the ear (Figure 23).
Agronomy and stem extension The benchmark heights are for crops receiving applications of PGR during both early and late stem extension. Early sowing, high nitrogen residues or lack of PGR contribute to tallness. Fertiliser nitrogen extends the penultimate internode and peduncle.
Lodging risk In tall crops, the aerial parts of the plant impose a large force on the stem base and root system, but variation in crop height is only a minor contributor to lodging risk.
Other factors are weight distribution along the shoot, root anchorage and stem strength. All components of lodging risk can be altered by choice of variety and husbandry.
The earlier that lodging occurs during grain filling, the greater the yield loss. Lodging can also adversely affect Figure 22. Final crop height results primarily from internode extension quality characteristics, such as Hagberg Falling Number Source: Hillary Broad, Annals of Applied Biology and specific weight.
How to measure height and lodging Use a metre ruler to measure the height from the The proportion of a crop that is lodged can be ground to the top of the stem, base of ear or top of assessed from its first occurrence.

Each internode starts to extend when the previous one has reached half its final length. The benchmark number of nodes in a wheat stem is four, giving five internodes as illustrated in Figure 22.
Crops sown earlier can have an extra internode and may be taller.
Node With a full PGR programme, the benchmark final height is 69 cm to the base of the ear. Without PGRs, crops Node can be as much as 20 cm taller.

Stems extend to 53 cm by full ear emergence (GS59) and reach their final Node height around theN otidmee of flowering (GS61) as shown in Figure 23.
Stem height does not reflect stem reserves, as taller stems have a greater proportion of structural materials that cannot be redistributed.

Stem carbohydrate storage Stem reserves contribute 20–50% of grain yield.
Key facts • Carbohydrate reserves are the major part of the dry matter redistributed from stems and leaves during grain filling. Protein is also redistributed • Soluble carbohydrate stem reserves reach a maximum of 2.7 t/ha between late booting and early grain filling • Variety and growing conditions can cause stem reserves to vary from <2 t/ha to >4 t/ha • Grain filling normally depends on stem reserves and photosynthesis. By harvest, almost all stem reserves have been relocated to the grain or lost through respiration Maximum stem storage 2.7 t/ha soluble carbohydrate Accumulation of stem reserves Varietal influence: High (GS31 until early grain filling) Other influences: Shoot number More assimilate is produced during the construction phase than is needed for structural tissues (Figure 24). The benchmark amount of soluble stem reserves at The surplus is stored in stems as fructan sugar, mainly in flowering is 2.3 t/ha (Figure 25). An additional 0.4 t/ha the pith of upper internodes – about 25% is in the accumulates by early grain filling.

Dry matter redistribution during grain filling 2.9 t/ha, of which 1.9 t/ha soluble carbohydrate Varietal influence: High Other influences: Redistribution of soluble reserves lasts from 26 days after flowering to the end of grain filling. The loss in straw dry matter between flowering and harvest is 2.9 t/ha, comprising 1.9 t/ha soluble stem reserves and protein from leaves and stems.
Reserves contribute significantly to yield under all post-flowering conditions. Varieties with highest yield potential tend to be those that accumulate greatest amounts of stem soluble carbohydrate. Stem carbohydrate storage is not included in the Recommended Lists but wheat breeders may be able to provide information on varietal differences.
Stem reserves contribute similar amounts of assimilate in stressed or unstressed crops. However, because yields are reduced in stressed crops, reserves contribute a higher proportion.
How to measure stem reserves After stems are fully extended, pull up at least 10 stems (taking care not to break them) and remove leaf laminae, roots and ears. Dry the whole stems rapidly (at around 100°C), weigh them and send them for analysis by an appropriate laboratory. To determine the soluble stem reserves on an area basis, you will need to know the number of tillers in an area and multiply this by the Water Soluble Carbohydrates (WSC) per stem.

Hence, to Varietal influence: High (grains/ear) realise potential yield, it is usually essential to maximise Other influences: Shoot numbers, pests grain numbers. Severe disease or drought can significantly reduce grain size.
The benchmark for grain number per ear is 48. With 460 surviving fertile shoots/m2, this gives 22,000 grains/m2, illustrated in Figure 26.
Varieties with smaller culm leaves tend to have more shoots/m2 and fewer grains/ear. Breadmaking varieties tend to have fewer grains/ear than other varieties.
Some insects, such as orange blossom midge, can reduce grain numbers and feed on developing grains.

Thus ‘tillers’ do not include the main or primary shoot Transpiration Loss of water vapour from a crop’s green surfaces, mainly through leaf pores (stomata) Vernalisation A change in the physiological state of a plant from vegetative to reproductive brought about by a period of cold – can be applied to seeds or (in the case of wheat) to the young plant Waterlogging Filling of soil pores with water to the extent that there is insufficient oxygen for normal root function 35

Stem elongation GS30 Ear at 1 cm (pseudostem erect) GS31 First node detectable GS32 Second node detectable GS33 Third node detectable GS37 Flag leaf just visible GS39 Flag leaf blade all visible Distance between base of the plant and the top of the shoot apex on the main stem is 1 cm or more, but the length of the 1st internode is less than 1 cm.
More 1 cm than 1 cm Less than 1 cm GS30 1 cm When stem elongation begins it is necessary to split the main shoot to determine the correct crop Growth Stage.
For a quick, but crude assessment, fold back the leaf sheaths then count the slight 'bumps' caused by each node.
The exact stage is revealed by stripping off leaves and cutting the main stem longitudinally with a sharp knife.
