COMBINABLE CROPS & SUGAR BEET STANDARDS OCTOBER 2022 VERSION 5: 1 OCTOBER 2022

CROPS STANDARDS DEAR VALUED MEMBER, Thank you for being part of the Red Tractor Crops assurance scheme.
Dear valued member, As I took on the role of sector board chair in January 2021, the process of developing these standards was already underway. This was an important time to listen to members. Accordingly, some tabled proposals have been dropped but others included, notably the requirement to show health and safety policies as part of the farm assessment.
Having such a policy is a legal requirement, but many felt that given recent farm fatality figures it was right that this scheme checks it is truly in place.
Government rules on Renewable Energy Directive (RED) eligibility have become more exacting, meaning from 1 July 2021 farmers must show figures on crop volumes going in and out of stores. This allows assured crops to be sold into the biofuels market.
This scheme also incorporates the Voluntary Initiative (VI), a cross-industry drive to reassure government that spray operators are professional and responsible when using pesticides. It requires sprayer operators to undertake the National Register of Sprayer Operators (NRoSO) training and an annual MOT for sprayers.
For simplicity, grain trailer ID marks now only need to be clearly identifiable, not shown on three sides. ID marks are not required unless transporting another farm’s grain into a thirdparty intake.
In an ever-changing world, Red Tractor assurance is your definitive point of reference for peace of mind that your farm business meets key requirements to supply the food chain, without additional checks and cost.
With ever-increasing interest and scrutiny of how food is produced, compliance with these standards not only serves to protect the reputation of your own farm, but the entire sector in which you play a vital part.
Here’s to a secure and sustainable future for British farming.
Best wishes, Guy Smith Former Chair, Red Tractor crops sector board 2 RED TRACTOR ASSURANCE FOR FARMS// COMBINABLE CROPS & SUGAR BEET STANDARDS ©Assured Food Standards 2022

The Red Tractor assurance journey begins on farms, and our members have a vital role to play in building and maintaining the trust of the British public.
As the provider of the UK’s largest and most comprehensive food standards scheme, Red Tractor is the lynch pin for the entire supply chain, balancing legislation and the competing demands of consumers, farmers, processors and retailers.
Our Standards are written, revised and approved by our Technical Advisory Committees and Sector Boards in close consultation with farmer representatives and leading industry experts, all working to future-proof the industry.
This is essential given the demand for food traceability, growing consumer awareness of animal welfare and pesticide issues and a need to protect and enhance the environment.
Please note that the standards must be read in conjunction with the Member Rules at the back of this manual, which all scheme members are bound by.

HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE Our standards are organised in sections. The AIM of each standard or group of standards is clearly explained. All of the words against each standard, including the column ‘How you will be measured’, form part of it.
Standard coding begins with a two-letter prefix which identifies the section (e.g. EC for Environmental Protection and Contamination Control). You may notice that the codes are not always consecutive – rest assured that no information is missing from this guide.
Assessors will use this code together with one to identify the enterprise to which it relates (e.g. CR for Combinable Crops and Sugar Beet) to record any non-conformances on the report at the end of the assessment.
Look out for the guidance boxes throughout this guide – these offer useful tips to help you meet the relevant standard.
Key while all standards must be met, particular attention should be paid to these as they can have implications for your certification Recommendation this is not a standard and a non-conformance raised will not affect your certification. However these are recommended actions to undertake to help demonstrate working to Red Tractor and industry core principles New a completely new standard which the member must now adhere to, or a new recommendation Revised a standard that has changed and requires the member to take some different or additional action to before Upgraded the standard has been upgraded to a Key standard or from a Recommendation to a full standard Appendix indicates that additional information is provided in the Appendices at the back of this manual and can also be found by visiting: redtractorassurance.org.uk R this icon indicates that a record is required and suggests potential documentary evidence which could be used to show compliance WHERE TO FIND HELP At the end of each section this icon indicates where you can get additional information, should you need it.

SIX STEPS TO RED TRACTOR ASSURANCE 1. APPLICATION Send an application and fee to your chosen certification body detailing all the relevant holdings/ premises. Receipt will be acknowledged in 14 days and the assessment will be arranged.
2. INITIAL ASSESSMENT The assessor will talk to you about your business as you walk together around (or facilitate remote viewing via video-streaming of) the facilities, look at the livestock/crop as applicable and check your paperwork.
They will need to talk to your staff too about what they do. Any areas which do not meet the standards (which we refer to as ‘non-conformances’) will be highlighted to you throughout the assessment.
They are not allowed to advise on, or suggest, how you need to correct things. You will be left or sent a report which will contain details of any non-conformances, an indication of the evidence you will be expected to provide (e.g. invoices, photos, photocopies, letter from vet) and the timescales for action.
3. NON-CONFORMANCES You must supply your certification body with evidence that you have corrected everything as explained in the non-conformance report.
In some cases, a revisit may be required and this may incur a charge. Your application will lapse if you do not correct everything satisfactorily and in good time.
4. ISSUE CERTIFICATE OF CONFORMITY Once satisfactory evidence has been provided, you will be entered as ‘Assured’ on the Scheme Member Checker database and you can then sell your product(s) as ‘Assured’.
You may receive an actual certificate in electronic format or printed, but the status on the Scheme Member Checker database is definitive.

5. RENEWAL You will be invited to renew your membership annually, 12 months after the initial assessment and every 12 months thereafter. You will receive a renewal notice and a maximum of two reminder letters.
6. ROUTINE ASSESSMENTS AND SPOT CHECKS An assessor will make routine visits (or carry out remote assessments) similar to your initial assessment to check you are continuing to conform to the standards at all times.
These assessments will normally be held no further apart than 12 months for crops, fresh produce, chicken, ducks and turkey schemes. Assessment timings may be altered to accommodate multiple schemes on one farm visit.

| GUIDANCE Definition of worker: https://www.gov.uk/employment-status A person is generally classed as a ‘worker’ if: – they have a contract or other arrangement to do work or services personally for a reward (your contract doesn’t have to be written) – their reward is for money or a benefit in kind, for example the promise of a contract or future work – they only have a limited right to send someone else to do the work (subcontract) – they have to turn up for work even if they don’t want to – their employer has to have work for them to do as long as the contract or arrangement lasts – they aren’t doing the work as part of their own limited company in an arrangement where the ‘employer’ is actually a customer or client |                                                                                                                                                                                         |                              |

Appendix VC.2 VERMIN CONTROL Non-chemical – lethal Risk Hierarchy (VC.2.a) When considering rodent control methods, the concept of a ‘risk hierarchy’ must be used. This means considering the use Chemical control methods of non-chemical control methods first, followed by the least toxic alternatives.
Other control methods Environmental risk assessment (VC.2.b) Where rodent control requires the use of toxic bait (rodenticides), an environmental risk assessment must be undertaken before laying bait. The risk assessment must cover the following:
■ W hat the treatment is designed to achieve, what methods of rodent control will be used and how success will be measured ■ W hich non-target species may be present in or near the treatment site ■ W hat steps have been/will be taken to prevent or adequately control exposure of wildlife/domestic pets and contamination of the environment ■ H ow dead rodents and rodenticides will be disposed of Bait Plan (VC.2.c) Records must be kept of baits used and checks made.
The standard outlines the information that must be recorded.
FURTHER GUIDANCE The Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulation 2002 (COSHH) requires that assessments be carried out to identify any risks to operators and others who may be affected by working with substances hazardous to health, such as rodenticides. If you have five or more employees, you must record your assessment but, even if you have fewer than five, it makes sense to write down what steps you have taken to identify the risks. The Health and Safety Executive provides an e-tool for completing the COSHH assessment, which can be found here: http://coshh-tool.hse.gov.uk/ Disposal of poisoned rodents The bodies of dead rodents may carry residues of rodenticides and, if eaten by predators or scavengers, may be a source of wildlife exposure to rodenticides. It is essential to carry out regular searches for rodent bodies, both during and after the treatment period. Bodies may be found for several days after rats have eaten the bait and rats may die up to 100 metres or more away from the baited site.
It is important to check with local authorities regarding appropriate routes of disposal of poisoned rodent carcasses and there may also be recommendations on the rodenticide product label. Red Tractor has been advised that poisoned rodents can be disposed of (in order of preference):
– in an on-farm incinerator for animal carcasses – with other waste as part of the domestic waste collection, securely bagged in a dustbin or wheelie bin (subject to local authority agreement) – off site at a suitably authorised incinerator or landfill – by burial on site, provided this is done away from sensitive areas 34 RED TRACTOR ASSURANCE FOR FARMS// COMBINABLE CROPS & SUGAR BEET STANDARDS ©Assured Food Standards 2022 RED TRACTOR ASSURANCE FOR FARMS// COMBINABLE CROPS & SUGAR BEET STANDARDS ©Assured Food Standards 2022

Appendix EC.9 SAFE APPLICATIONS TO LAND Non-chemical – lethal This appendix provides guidance on making applications to land. All applications to land must be carried out in accordance with legislation. Environmental Permits or exemptions must be held where applicable. If your farm is in an NVZ you must also follow NVZ rules.
Chemical control methods Note: Producers should always check with buyers to ensure that any applications of sludge, compost, digestate and other materials originating outside the farm are acceptable to customers.
Other control methods Sewage Sludge (biosolids) For further information, including the Biosolids Assurance Scheme (BAS) Standard, refer to https://assuredbiosolids.co.uk/.
Evidence of BAS Certified Biosolids should be provided by your biosolids supplier and can be verified in the Certification section of the BAS website.
Farmyard Manure (FYM) and Slurry – Fresh, Stored or Treated Batch storage of solid manures and slurries for at least 6 months (that is with no additions of fresh manure made to the store during this period) or ‘active’ treatment, are effective methods of killing pathogens.
Composting of solid manures is a particularly effective method of controlling microbial pathogens, but for best results the process needs to be actively managed. The manure should be treated as a batch and turned regularly (at least twice within the first 7 days) either with a front-end loader or preferably with a purpose-built compost turner. This should generate high temperatures over a period of time (e.g. above 55°C for 3 days) which are effective in killing pathogens and this temperature should be monitored. Allow the compost to mature as part of the treatment process. The whole process should last at least 3 months.
Lime treatment of slurry (addition of quick lime or slaked lime to raise the pH to 12 for at least 2 hours) is an effective method of inactivating bacterial pathogens. Allow the slurry to mature as part of the batch treatment process for at least 3 months prior to land spreading.
Although pathogens can be killed by exposure to sunlight, you should incorporate manures into the soil as soon as is practicable. This will reduce the potential for direct crop contamination as well as reduce odour and ammonia emissions.
Compost, Digestates and other Recycled Materials It is recommended that digestates and composts sourced from external contractors for application to land have been produced to the relevant PAS specification (PAS 110 for digestate, PAS 100 for compost) and are applied following the associated quality protocol. The specifications and quality protocols provide safeguards on the feedstock materials, the processing stages and end product quality.
Where anaerobic digestate is produced from an energy crop feedstock (e.g. maize) and there is no pasteurisation step there is a risk that plant pathogens, for example Fusarium spp., may be present. It is recommended that energy crop digestate is ploughed in before drilling a subsequent cereal crop.
Biostimulants Some biostimulant products are derived from mammalian tissue by-products, including pork and beef material.
It is essential to check the acceptability of their use with your trade customers or buyers.

Appendix EI.3 LAND USED TO PRODUCE CROPS FOR BIOFUELS, BIOLIQUIDS AND BIOMASS Summary of Requirements Producers who may supply crops into the biofuel, bioliquid and biomass supply chains must not produce from areas of land with high biodiversity or of high carbon stock or peatland (unless evidence is provided that the cultivation and harvesting does not involve drainage of previously undrained soil. This is a requirement under the recast Renewable Energy Directive (EU) 2018/2001; articles 29(3), 29(4), 29(5)1.

Appendix EI.3 (continued) LAND USED TO PRODUCE CROPS FOR BIOFUELS, BIOLIQUIDS AND BIOMASS Retained EU legislation Commission Regulation (EU) No1307/20141 establishes the following definitions:
■ ‘grassland’ means terrestrial ecosystems dominated by herbaceous or shrub vegetation for at least 5 years continuously. It includes meadows or pasture that is cropped for hay but excludes land cultivated for other crop production and cropland lying temporarily fallow. It further excludes continuously forested areas as defined in Article 17(4)(b) of Directive 2009/28/EC (now replaced by Article 29(4)(b) of the recast Renewable Energy Directive (EU) 2018/2001) unless these are agroforestry systems which include land-use systems where trees are managed together with crops or animal production systems in agricultural settings. The dominance of herbaceous or shrub vegetation means that their combined ground cover is larger than the canopy cover of trees; ■ ‘human intervention’ means managed grazing, mowing, cutting, harvesting or burning; ■ ‘degraded’ means not characterised by long-term loss of biodiversity due to for instance overgrazing, mechanical damage to the vegetation, soil erosion or loss of soil quality ■ ‘species rich’ means a habitat of significant importance to critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable species as classified by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species or other lists with a similar purpose for species or habitats laid down in national legislation or recognised by a competent national authority in the country of origin of the raw material; or i. a habitat of significant importance to endemic or restricted-range species; or ii a habitat of significant importance to intra-species genetic diversity; or i a habitat of significant importance to globally significant concentrations of migratory species or congregatory species; or iv a regionally or nationally significant or highly threatened or unique ecosystem The definitions of ‘degraded’ and ‘species rich’ apply to Land that was highly biodiverse forest and Land that was highly biodiverse grassland.
Retained EU legislation Commission Regulation (EU) No1307/2014 also clarifies that grasslands in the following geographic ranges of the EU shall always be regarded as highly biodiverse grassland:
■ habitats listed in Annex I to Council Directive 92/43/EEC ■ habitats of significant importance for animal and plant species of Union interest listed in Annexes II and IV to Directive 92/43/EEC ■ habitats of significant importance for wild bird species listed in Annex I to Directive 2009/147/EC (also retained EU legislation: https://w.legislation.gov.uk/eudr/2009/147/contents) 1 Retained EU legislation Commission Regulation (EU) No1307/2014 https://w.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2014/1307/data.pdf RED TRACTOR ASSURANCE FOR FARMS// COMBINABLE CROPS & SUGAR BEET STANDARDS ©Assured Food Standards 2022 37

Appendix EI.3 (continued) LAND USED TO PRODUCE CROPS FOR BIOFUELS, BIOLIQUIDS AND BIOMASS Requirements of recast Renewable Energy Directive (EU) 2018/2001 Article 29(4) Conservation of carbon stocks Biofuels and bioliquids shall not be made from raw material obtained from land with high carbon stock that is, land that had one of the following statuses in January 2008 and no longer has that status ■ Land that was wetland A wetland is land that is covered with or saturated by water permanently or for a significant part of the year ■ Land that was continuously forested Continuously forested areas are defined as land spanning more than one hectare with trees higher than 5m and a canopy cover of more than 30% or trees able to reach those thresholds in situ Continuously forested areas do not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use.
Agricultural land use refers to tree stands in agricultural production systems, such as fruit tree plantations, oil palm plantations and agroforestry systems when crops are grown under tree cover ■ Forested land with 10-30% canopy cover Forested areas with 10–30% canopy cover are defined as land spanning more than one hectare with trees higher than 5m and a canopy cover of between 10% and 30%, or trees able to reach those thresholds in situ, unless evidence is provided that the carbon stock of the area before and after conversion is such that, when the methodology laid down in part C of Annex V is applied, the greenhouse gas threshold set out in the Directive would still be fulfilled.
These provisions shall not apply if, at the time the raw material was obtained, the land had the same status as it had in January 2008.
Requirements of recast Renewable Energy Directive (Directive 2018/2001) Article 29(5) Conservation of peatlands Biofuels and bioliquids shall not be made from raw material obtained from land that was peatland in January 2008 ■ An exception is possible if evidence is provided that the cultivation and harvesting of that raw material does not involve drainage of previously undrained soil ■ For peatland that was partially drained in January 2008 a subsequent deeper drainage, affecting soil that was not fully drained, would constitute a breach of the criterion Recast Renewable Energy Directive (Directive 2018/2001) Documentation Requirements Documents for verification of previous land status must be retained for 5 years and made available for inspection by the assessor. Such documents may include Single Farm Payment documentation, maps or other of official records showing field location and classification/use.
For the purposes of the recast Renewable Energy Directive (Directive 2018/2001), mass balance records must be kept at a site level, as outlined in standard EI.2.
For combinable crops, producers must sign the related declaration on sustainability on the Post-Harvest Declaration (grain passport) for crop loads produced on recast Renewable Energy Directive (Directive 2018/2001) eligible land.
For sugar beet, in addition to keeping traceability records (as required by standard TI.a), a Grower Identification Card must accompany each load.
Documentation relating to wetlands must reflect seasonal changes within a year.

Appendix RA.1 CIPC STORE RISK ASSESSMENT Any store in which chlorpropham (CIPC) treatments have taken place or which has contained CIPC treated potatoes for any period of time may not be suitable for the future storage of crops where no approval for the use of CIPC exists e.g. cereals. This is because the risk of CIPC contamination of the crop is possible and could lead to illegal residues contaminating the stored crop. CIPC is volatile and any stored crop can be contaminated from the atmosphere within the store without any necessity for physical contact with the floor or walls.
Vacuuming and steam cleaning a contaminated store may reduce the concentrations of CIPC on the fabric of the store. However, it will be extremely difficult to remove traces of CIPC that have penetrated into the fabric of materials.
In order to avoid the risk of having a valuable crop contaminated with CIPC it is essential to check the history of the store before use. If a comprehensive record of storage is not available and you cannot be sure that CIPC has not been used then testing of the fabric of materials within the building should be carried out before any other crops are stored.

Appendix RA.1 CIPC STORE RISK ASSESSMENT Store fabric sampling method for CIPC residue analysis 1. A sample can be made up from dust, chippings of concrete from the floor, scrapings from bricks, pointing mortar, slivers of wood from the fabric, plaster board, insulation material etc. Ensure hands are washed clean before the samples are taken.
2. About 10-15 grams is required for analysis (a pile in the palm of a hand), but it is vitally important that this is as representative as possible and made up of random sub-samples taken from all around the store.
3. Contact your chosen analytical laboratory to check they can test for CIPC from fabric material and the cost.
The analytical cost should be approximately £100 per sample.
4. Put the sample in small marked and sealed plastic freezer bag in an outer jiffy bag with all your details and post to the laboratory. A number of analytical laboratories will be able to undertake this test. Examples include:

BUILDING TRUST AND ADVANCING BRITISH AGRICULTURE FOR OVER TWO DECADES In the wake of damaging food scares, Red Tractor was founded with a clear mission to rebuild public trust in the food produced by British farmers.
Since 2000, we have worked with consumers, our farmer members, food processors and retailers to create the UK's largest and most comprehensive food standards scheme.
Today, it is Britain’s most-trusted food assurance scheme, with more than three-quarters of shoppers viewing it is as independent and trustworthy.
The Red Tractor symbol is a hallmark of quality British food and drink that is easily recognised by shoppers and diners.
We are proud to work with 50,000 farmer members to produce food and drink to world-leading standards worth £14bn to the UK economy.
The progress we have made does not mean our journey is at an end. Red Tractor will always strive to support and advance British agriculture in producing food that is traceable, safe and farmed with care.
