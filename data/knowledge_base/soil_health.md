# Soil Health Management

- Test soil organic matter every season and record the pH.
- Keep pH between 6.0 and 7.5 for most vegetables.
- Apply compost at 2-4 tons per hectare to boost microbial activity.
- Avoid tilling wet soil to prevent compaction.
- Mulch bare ground to reduce evaporation by up to 70%.
